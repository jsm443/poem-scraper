11,541

11,541 days a breath
With nothing standing in my way
I can live and walk into the sure, unsure
Cutting paths to wilderness, song to wind
But to attribute THIS to my own success 
Is but wishes and hopes 
Nothing more or less

    





1250

No bound amount of times compress
Could pressurized this want in me

Leaving other lovers not by the wayside
But with a future of their own to be

Arise and fall, my beating chest
With a breath anew and deep words to breathe

Let me not invest in unstanding still
But in a redemptive song bursting forth, wild and free

    





1487

The human spirit falls 
Not because of weight
Or snagging stone 
But because of rainbows end
Of water vapors shining spirit
And because our nature is 
To go

    





1700

By the height of skyscrapers 
These glorious buildings glowing brightly in the New York sky
Though people wouldn't know it of me
(my alone if they tried)
Someday perhaps you'll come to realize this
and in seeing (through the glass) notice
That I was here all along standing quietly beside

    





2238

Perhaps one day
These eyes will know
The other side of the sky 
(That is mine)
And your mind too
In all of its reassuring glory
With its own sunshine
Each morning in tow

No night shadow will ever come between
Such bright and glowing
Stream fed eyes as these
(Which glow as one)
And hope to never be parted from 
This earth in all of its grounding ways
Just as your sight cuts deep
So does that movement which you've yet to know

My eyes will always wait for yours

    





A beautiful cold will come

No more can you change
The harsh, cold, reality of winter
So much as you can
Choose to warm yourself then 
When the sheen of eventual summer is sprung

Don't take the seasons personally
Like dawns and sunsets on the rise
They always come

    





A Beautiful Miss Young Summer In New York

You are a head turn in a crowded station
A mere reflection in a city bus passing by
You with your life embued and color renewed
Like New York after the fall of a subtle June
You are ever growing effortlessly grown
Like bridges and high wires in the sunlit sky
You are stretching and cleverly reaching
Whispering quietly with easy by traffic side 
Peacekeeping being of elvish beating
And your heart the very least of things
By which I would wish you too described

No words do the essence of your summer justice
All around and within song
Blessed is the man who sees such beauty each morning
And where it secretly resides

    





A Beautiful Sight Well-Known (Struck)

And then I saw it 
And I knew
Overtaken as I was
That all of my prior perceptions of beauty were nothing
And that your memory 
Was a far sight from all of God's green glory
Creative and free as the cattails and the rustic leaves
For which I am thankful
Most thankful

    





A Beleif

I value creation
I care about outcome 
I live not for me
But to die everyday
To away from the old ways
I flee

    





Aberdeen

Pouring rain,
Heavy hearts,
Human minds. 

Falling down,
I remind,
You of me. 

Puddling,
In the streets,
Of Aberdeen. 

Scottish eyes,
Over me,
The North Sea. 

Split apart,
Come to meet,
Locally. 

Heavy clouds,
Pouring in,
Out of me.

Would you ever,
Meet with me,
In Aberdeen? 

Be as one,
We would be,
Don and Dee.

    





A Blueberry Haiku

Haikus are like Blue
Berries bursting in my mouth
Always gone too soon

    





A book for whom and why

A write is such a wrong
If found (in) to be nothing more
Than a turning out
Not of ideas
Or truths 
Or questions 
Or desires
But of disregard for craft
And the pretensions of these selfish liars

Create to make, not make sum

    





About Ideal

Fear me not 
Lest judgement find
That I am not matching
Not molded out of or shaped being
To that sculpture of which
Has been always there
In your mind

All that is, is already made
Or so I find

    





Above My Chest, Beneath My Chin, She Fits

Smooth as softened alabaster 
Their scent to you an immeasurable bliss
Where the sun tucks the moon beneath his chin
Rests an endless dream no more than a wish 

(4LINE)

    





A Bridge Over Wonder

How can you mend a bridge that's never been crossed,
In the daylight under the sun?

How can you climb beneath the turquoise sea,
And swim to the base of a mountain undone?

How can you find a way to the clearing's edge, 
Where the waterless streams beneath willows weep? 

And how much of you and I can be found,
Together, if to our opposite sides we keep?

    





Absence And Presence

Nobody dreams anymore when they sleep
How they wake to find 
That their dreams of the day are not met
Will not meet
How long will this nightmare continue to be?
Like a daily life with eyes wide shut
Squeezing tightly until its extinguished from me

    





Abstinence

For months now
I've withheld myself
From all words indulging 
From all spinning worlds
Both earned and bought

Then today I thought
"Why should I or not"
As neither quiet nor speaking
Changes any amount of this 
My most ardent thought 

So I did
And this was

    





A Burning Haiku For The Cold Old Soul

A fire never burns 
Nearly as bright as when it's
First memory's lit

    





Abuse Of Sleep

There is no peace

When you find yourself
Persuing sleep
As if it were non-exsistance

There is no rest
In such restlessness of spirit

    





A Cabin Hymn

Your soul 
A cabin as it should
Surrounded by forgiving trees
And friendly fern laid paths beneath
Your sound
And sound is that of thrushes knocking
Cattails waiving friends goodbyes
With summers long once gone to rest
In other counties
I'm glad you tried
To keep that hymnal you alive

In my country you did belong

    





Accessibility

Mountains take an eternity to tear down and build up, and yet confidence can be drawn from a well within minutes.  All one requires is time, while the other requires the desire.

    





A Challenge

Waiting for the Lord

As the soul waits for the wind 
As hands wait for the friend
As homes wait for each of these

Small beings no more than the grassy seas
Just as rain is sent by the lord again
So that all of these may grow and be

I **** at accepting gifts

    





A change of walking ways

Knowingly walking down the path of frustration 
And expecting to be happy
Is not a problem of feet
But an expectant problem of mind

And so I find
That I must walk in a different manner
To be free

    





A Cheeky Picture (These Are My Knees)

These 
Are my knees 
And I would get down on them
Over and over again
For you and then
And then

    





Achene

Crack this walnut chest and cash
The meat of center 
The core of homegrown soul 
Or let fall beside the parental tree
To roll and go and be buried and grow 
Into a walnut cash of its own

    





A Chilling Exhaustion

Sleep seeps from my finger tips
With chilling thoughts, my mind amiss
No matter how much heat I ingest 
I digress, and fade into cold extremities 
Only a few times, have I know 
The name of tired as well as this

    





Aching Beating Heart

My heart aches for home

For the untitled song

For the awkward communications which are yet to come

For the hiss of the radiator 

And the warmth between walls

There's a pain in my chest

And it reverberates slow

Like the pounding sound of my favorite lofo song

    





A Chirping Sound

This song
Your sound
Is like crickets or grasshoppers 
Their unfathoming fate
Happily found
Although I can't decide which
Or where they would be

    





A Colm In The World

The balance between quiet and community 
The calming free and the crunch of expectant others, ew
How to wish and wish
That I would not be
Bound by such constraints
As myself and me
(So often imposed)

Ick

    





A Colored Coin

Who am I to say what I need
What color my feelings are painted today
On this time and dime turned 
Like a coin thrown down 
Who am I to say what I’m becoming now
?

    





A Comet I Couldn't Name

From a place of light
I pray she falls 

A star in another mans backyard
Wholly, for she was bright enough for all

I just prefer the daylight bright
Just as the Summer prefers the Spring over the latter Fall

    





A Comparison

I... 
Was an arrow from a bow named Young Summer

And he... 
Was nothing more than a crooked quiver in the cold of Winter

    





A Constant Dream

There is no human hope
Which a train, a plane, or breeze
Cannot whisk away at a steady pace

But the sunlight calls
In its glorious dawning truth revealed 
With each day arriving still

No cloud can keep us from the sun
Forever less 
From each other be it willed

    





A constant, reoccurring, wish of mine

(Wishing)
Not on stars, or skies
Not on rocks, or trees
Not on mountains, or valleys
Or on rivers, or streams

Not on daylight, or night
Not on waking, or sleep
Not on coins, or on clovers
But on prayer that you will see
(Me)

    





Acorns

Tear the idea limb from limb, until the acorn of truth falls.
And then, rend the earth and begin again.
Until another, and another
And another thought begins.
Growing slowly with every Fall.

    





A couple talking beneath a skylight

Where skylines bend
And sunglow lights
Our pyre bed on which we live 
Such combustive talks
And opinions which once were given
Give way to sleep, to rest, to need
And to an understanding so carved, so dutifully deep
That even skylines cannot touch or reach our valleys found
Where we are have been
In growing roots deep

    





A Creator

Give me space and the freedom to feel it out
Into the existence which wasn't meant to be
But would never have been
Without the vision
Without me

I am a selfish, most biased, creator of worlds

    





Across The Sky

The truth is written there
Clear as day and yet shrouded as the night
<strong>Across the sky</strong>
That I am the only one who knows 
Who I've written about 
And why

    





A Cry For Quiet

The moment someone knows me
The moment someone sees
I exist
I am present
I am back to being me

And so I go where noone knows me
To where I'm openly not seen
To not exist for a few hours
Is such a blessing
Not to be

    





a departure is a form of greeting

hello is not a word
so much as a greeting is a sky
which stretches out above our heads
into the coulded mists and parting looks of waiting eyes

    





A different type of glow

Perhaps you are not as you seem
Or perhaps the problem
As it always has been
Resides with me

For I am my not that
As I am not awake
But that too often now I have gone to dreams
And dreams don't die for me 

Instead I breathe 
And in sleeping 
Wake

    





A Different Universe

You've grown up into your own space
And I've settle back into mine
Now all I need is to be more content
With our galaxies never crossing
Never meant to collide

    





A Dove In The Storm

No one and everyone
On the wings of nothing
Above winds of something
.
Less storms not come
And time not find
That no human mind ever spoke aloud
..
No cloud or raindrops ever having held on too long
Nor I to you clung so fervently as
Like static electric enchantment capacity
…
These are not but a blink in the eye
Of a storm so mighty and fierce in sky 
Which devours like an hour
..
You and I both know 
That no dove be ever caught 
Dead to flying right in a storied storm
.
Though in mind it is certainly not
By any means explanatory
Or for want of try to fly

    





A Dream

As the fragments of a mirror
Once did shatter
Stuck in place
It cannot be, turn back the clock
It couldn't be your face

    





A Dreams Remind

I wish for dreams and when I have
They remind me that my soul yearns for yours
As you hold the only hope alive 
Of hearing admits understanding
Of heartbeats within quiet warmth 

Do you dream of me as equally alive?

    





Adventurous Worry

Rarely do I understand
The beginning as it begins

Rarely do I comprehend and recognize
The middle of any consequence
As it leads to its inevitable, relatable, end

Rarely is how I would say
And without breadth
Is how all great adventures begin

    





Advice from a young man who loves his own memories

The further you get
from the vision of dream
.
The less you can see 
clearly as a calm content being
..
Your own self currently therein 
...
The further toward the inaction you grow
the more tree like you become
....
So BREAK FREE and be free 
while you are still young
.....
Tomorrow is for old age and memory

    





Advised

I* ill *advised</em>
  <strong>Because</strong> there are some things
      <strong>Which</strong> time will not fix
         <strong>Nor</strong> heal, or mold, or meld within mind
            <strong>When</strong> they simply are what simply is
               <strong>That</strong> is something for which 
                  <strong>Only</strong> you can decide

    





A eulogy of us

I haven't forgotten you 
Or fallen softly into the arms of the forlorn
Almost memories no more, no
I haven't forgotten because because
I haven't forgotten the last of us
Of which once was
So much more

I still remember

    





A Fair Question

Familiarity follows those
Who have gone out already and found 

When you love them more than you love you
The happenstance will've already happened 

And in whistling through this life of old
Remember then the better, bitter, end 

Are you breathing for alive
Or are you just sleeping through sounds?

    





A Feeling

Even when I'm nothing
This something
Drives me 
Mad

    





A Feeling Once Felt

Such love stretches out above mountains and trees
Into distant nights and ocean valleys deep
Into stars and seas 
Where only the masked and glowing beings beam
And words go without sound nomore unseen
Such is love stretching out into this universe of being
Until they're shared by you and dissipating from me

    





A Few Favorites

My favorites are named like Midnight Rain, with Marshmallow toffee in the Skye.

Beneath Weeping Willow dreams a dream, of Elizabeth and her Squires.

Midst the Rose's Kelly is always found, neath the Sun and Princess shine.

Untill the Star's BG in the background be, glow these favoring words of mine

    





A Floating Fly

When the vacuum snaps 
And Ahab is pulled beneath the calm waters of the world
The only surface tension that remains is dispelled by the ripple of intensity
And the underlying opportunity
That the tension of escape and the capture beneath provides
When the vacuum snaps almost instantly

    





Afloat Somehow

In an ocean of adulthood
My head doesn't swim
It bobs and crashes in a flooded dream
Where I am not myself
Nor what I wish I could be

At sea

    





A Frigid Tanka

Cold sunshine, seeps down
On a day without hope and
Brings forward anew
Like a sound without new sound
On us, cold sunshine beats down

    





After The Fade

Saying you will 
Is not doing at all

Just as doing without
Is not reason in the least 

Man and woman need meaning
More than the other
More than anything

    





After The Self Control

Learning how to say no
Doesn't make it any less easy
Or anymore fun to be without 
That whatever-it-is
Which you think you need
And in your moment of doubt
Never did

    





after years rewrite

I'm dying at this opportunity 
trying not to think, as I
my old self would
with anxiousness and wonderous worry
at these days to hurry
so that this history might
rewrite itself 
and this time, this time
might not pass us by

    





againness and goodbyes

you can leave (and away) any ordinary day
but you can’t always come back and walk
down this particular way
again

    





Ageless

To love is to appreciate the other.

The complexities of mind and heart. 

The fraying string stretched inbetween. 

And the newness of each breath to start.

    





A Gentleman's Coattails

Long strides 
His flashing coattails on the countryside 
Winding like a sight but for a desperate moment
No less in his footprints often found 

But as a pumping heart with a walking pulse  
And a wondering mind no more contrived 
He knows not yet instead
He decides

    





A Gentlemen's Love

To hold her for hours
And hours on end

The desire of he 
Who contends with discomfort
And fights for her future
Be it not his own

These are the paths which only he knows
Lonely though they may ever be
He walks
Steadily into the good night 

A light
Alone

Thank God
My sin is my own

    





Age old warrior

These humans have stoked my fires of old
With their chest beating brows
With their self praising pride

And so with my own and this hand of mine
I will move swifter than wind 
And do my best to be better

And so they will find soon enough
In the waiting, wanting
In the destructive test

    





Age Revealed

Torn is not unmendable
Youth is not invincible
Just as age is not infoulable
Too old too fast
Too wise too late
But aware at least until the very last

    





A Gift

A little vial of the light that's behind my eyes, next to the wrinkles. Would you keep it on a chain around your bed post? And pull it out from beneath your pillow, occasionally, when you cannot sleep, to illuminate the night?

    





A Girl Named Sunrise

Gentle dawn
Tilts her head to a simple side
Just like a lover

Her embrace and longing kiss
Opening wider than a day is long
And a night is alive

With ease and gentleness alike
Her hand comes to rest
On my resting knee

As I gently reach for a single moment
Turned memory
Which can be savored for eternity

    





A Glancing Haiku

Look at me in turn
And see only this second 
Passing eyes meet

    





A Glass of Humility

I say this with a glass of humility 
That I've built worlds up and down these streets
And surrounded myself with all manner of things
Which I've pulled from inside of myself and out
And spread around 
Like butter on my creative roll 
With only this glass to wash it down
I am hungry for the here and not 
The creation which keeps me wide awake 
When all others have fallen asleep in my town
Even this very expression was kept on a shelf
Hence why... 
I generally keep such things to myself 
For a glass of humility is better than milk
At settling my mind and stomach down

    





A Goodbye, Never Hello

(Of Me)

I have my eyes 
My tested heart 
And know not where else to find what flies
Beneath such Carnelian skies as these

An Easterling I’ve been all my life 
Lost within memory until such days arrived 

So I asked my God the other day 
<strong>What should keep me here
Ought to make me say?</strong>
 
And I prayed he’d open up my eyes, be seen
My ears intent on what could be 
No more than the simple rustling leaves 

And then like an opal 
There nestled within the rolling green  
Your words spoke in whispers like the hemlock trees

(To You) 

And now, say not a word at present, please
My distant friend 
If you are joyful and in sated bliss without me 

Full of heart and with brimming mind 
Contented with this newfound sky 

But again, if you ever you find yourself free
Ever at ease 
Devoid of attachment, soul, or being 
Your essence adrift like the sun each morning
Before your first cold step into the dawn anew, then please

Don’t wait for the newborn leaves to color
Don’t search for the old lines in rearrangement to be  
Don’t wait for a second without such a thought 
Since the one still waiting, is me 

Be it regardless in passing
I wish you more than just well 
More than a sunset sound to be quelled 

Would you please be as well 
And I will also 

(Me)

    





A grain of nothing

Opinions are like grains of sand
they're going to exist 
regardless of if you're at the beach or not

    





A Growing Young Man Perpetual

It's been forever now
Since my evergreen heart grew wild and free
With budding oaks, and leaves, and lilac strong
With edelweiss glimmering alive in the evening lights 
And even the occasional ****
Poking its head up to remind through the matted red coals beneath
It's been forever now
But I hope that it won't always be
As such

    





A Guarantee

Such a person will flatter you and charm you
And try so hard to be what you need 
But then again, they’ll never be a true mirror
And they’ll never be as reflective as me

    





A Habit

How to let old habits die?
To let the quiet stillness of the mind be
To be content 
To be accepted 
To be both the present and the virtue 
How do you let old habits die?
The trick is
To let life breathe

    





A Haiku For My Shadow

Slowly following
Never will he let me be
For eternity

    





A Haiku For The Quiet Frustration

Into the night there.
My voice erupts to no-one
close, without you near.

    





a haiku for when it rains internally

You don't see me when
I cry, or spill over, you
see me when it rains

    





A Haiku, Unwound

Try as ever you
May not be enough this time
As all clocks unwind

    





A handwritten Me

There is no time left in the sky today. All that remains is the darkness of eve which this growing day has left behind....

    





A Heart, Abandoned Home

Condemned 
My heart 
Please open up

Infuse 
With earth
This growing song

Amend
And then
In breathing long

Alive 
My mind
In moving on

    





A Hearts Contest

I wouldn't be surprised if she didn't come back. Why? Because I'm here, and I'm a most formidable threat to contest.

    





A Heart Tree Haiku

Inside every tree
Once grown, is a seed of life
And death yet to be

    





A Heavy Pen

When you look at me
See not my deeds
But the gravitas behind who I've become

See me and only me
If you please

    





Ahiakutruth

No time is biteless
Memories worthless to those
Too hungry to see

    





A History of Said and Unsaid

Saying I'm tired
Is an insult to sleep
Just as ignoring our what hasn't been said</em>
Is a insult to me

    





A Home Already Known

Neither fear nor memory
This face unfound 
I am
Never was 
Having since been freed 
To find each other in this continual roam 
I am all patched up and ever headed, awaiting, home

    





A home lost, a home found

I lost my heart
And haven't found a care
I built my arms up - to carry us
(And can't)
I found out how I would fair 

This world, this wind
This rounding of homes
Knows nothing of the me now
(I've been)
The boy you used to know 

Having built myself around you - now
I know where I have been

    





Air, An Unseen Love

My heart a raindrop
Crashing onto your concrete world
Bursting into the hopefulness of another dream run down the drain
I am movement at least
Directionally found
In the mother nature sounds of time
And yet it is down I fall
End-over-end and time-after-time
Having kissed the sky with a lasting lament
And with amendments for you
I fall like the rain from  on high
My hopes
My love 
The thin air I am falling through

    





A Jealous Tanka - Her Brown Hair Fine

Between collarbone 
and eyes, your smile fair and fine.
Like fields of fast grown
barley, your brown hair reminds
Me, of jealousy flowing.

    





A Laugh At Self

And you want to get lost in the recesses of your mind? There is only you there, what do you expect to find?

    





A Less Social Me

Has realized
That a train station is not an evil place
Inherently
It's just busy

    





A Letter Sent To No One

Address a letter to noone ever
And send it on it's way
Into the gloom of another well packed bag
To be carried out and then whisked away

Let your focus not fall on the other
Let the falsehood, the penmanship
And all of the subtle friendlessness
Be mailed into the distant future
Far far away

Just address a letter to no one ever
And alone forever you'll ever stay

    





A Life Most Human

I am steam from the kettle
I am the smoke from the pipe
I am the wisp upon the willow limbs
The stillness in the dead of night
The steel upon the tracks which lie
The wings on the back which flies
Like skyscrapers in the burning distant sight 
I am the final swings of the scratching fight

    





Alive In God

A man, searching
Finds no door or exit sign
In any amount of word comprised

Instead
He is only found in less of himself
And in more of his God, found alive

    





All Along

When you know
You just know
By no human means, no
But when you know 
Truly know 
You just know
Since you've known

    





All A Man Can Do

When all you can do 
And I mean really do, is pray
You have to let go of certain things

You have to step aside be it left or right
And follow the one path, down the one way

Not to mention that you have to be very selective
When determining whatever mood you choose to linger in

And I do mean you choose</em>
Or else you'll falter

At least such a thing rings true to me
Because all I can do is pray for you
And chose my mood and mindset most carefully

Because quite literally as a man thinks 
It says, *so shall he be

    





All Humans Glow At Least Once

Sometimes
We all shine
Be it from powered stars or reflective moon
Out of conscious or uncommon try
Or peculiarity of mind
Well all are
At least capable of such kind emergence

    





All I Can Do, Around You

Struck speechless
Stretched for words I am
As I have never been
This close to you 
And all I can do I can do is grin

    





All In All

Who knows the path most meant for you? 
Who knows the meaning of it all?

Who knows how many trees bear fruit and precious leaves which fail to fall?

Who knows which way the wind does weep? 
Who knows the path each snowflake takes?

Who knows the choices we wrestle with? 
Who knows the trouble we ourselves make? 

Who's at the end of the lonesome road? 
Who's name is the only name to call?

Who knows the WHY behind the world? 
The answer is the ALL in ALL.

    





And So I Wait

The strongest men are not made of steel 
They’re not born of iron or lined with ore 
No the strongest men will wait and endure  
For whatever they want
Until the world turns no more

    





And yet...

The day of my life is not eternal
Neither without the warmth of the sunlit hands
Nor the chilling stare of the moons bright eye 
And yet…
As the days amidst the months pass by, like the tides 
So I stop and start my heart from beating
Autonomic is this loving way of mine

    





An echo over ears

When ears ache 
And beg for the sweet quiet release of thought 

How I plead for silence to find me
So that I can think again as myself

Wishing ever to be
At home, alone

Me 
Free

Please 
Let me be

    





A need for romance is being

Waiting is neither romantic nor fun
Neither easy or true
It simply is
A choice to be made 
To wait is to see
To decide is to see it through

    





A New Month, A New Chance

With every month that fades away, don't live in fear of what you're forgetting. But try anew as you always have, to find the truth of you, in each new setting...

    





A Nights Prior Tired

With that
A weariness crept up close upon me 
Without a word or caustic look
More silent than a shadow stalks 
More lonely than an abandoned Rook
It jumped and I fell fast asleep
Surely as weariness, consciousness, and companionship exist
I feel, as if only one of these can be
Whence awake

    





An Observation

Those two are like jazz
In both song and spirit
Full of unexpected twists and turns
Highs and lows
Peaks and valleys
Moors and mist

    





An Ocean View to Hear

Rain falls
Hopes rise
Mountains crumble over lifetimes small

Night skies blink
Struck by waking tides
And waves crash down till no more tall

The humans run and walk their lives
Into beneath, beside, and in
The massive wonders of God alive

And yet so few ever stop to see
To breathe in these
Before their very eyes

Goodbyes

    





A North Carolina Man

Tall, once grown
A tree needs neither sap nor season
To pine

(for her)

    





Another artists eyes

I asked for you
For your hand to show
It's contoured mark it my life
For eternity
And now
Years later 
Into the future we've found
Out the open truth in the air
Above smiling eyes and wide with joy
I laugh out loud
When you walk in again
And that maybe someday
Is suddenly now

Do you remember still?
I never forget.

    





Another Name Forgotten

Waiting patiently. Hoping to catchup with the most honest time. The kind which chimes but doesn't turn, more than a second at a time. The kind which doesn't know how to lie, even when it's meant in kind. I see you now. I see you in goodbye. And I'm gladly rid of your hypocrisy. Nice try.

    





An Outburst of Truth

You know, the easiest part of saying or reading someone else's words, is that you get to walk away from them at the end of the day.

    





An Over Thinkers Haiku

Clever call me not
Late to truth perhaps so worth
never without thought

    





Anthem

I am that which trades time 
For opportunity 
Love for freedom 
And hate for impartial passion

    





Anthem of the living hope

Walk under the stars
Wake under the sun
Swim under the water
And play beneath your someone

Smile when the crows gather
And laugh at crowds who call you anything 
Because you are not that-which is in chains
But as free as all of these things are above

    





Antidote

The most amazing thing
That a young man can do
Is age gracefully into the embrace of order
And out of the chaotic confusions of youth

    





Antisocial Me

Sometimes I just want to escape
Not that the life around me is profoundly filled with bars and chains
But that doesn't change the fact that I
Still wish myself away sometimes
To where no one knows my name

    





Anything But Such A Sign

Sweet as fruit
And looking too
Until the sun crashes down
Upon pale skinned youth
And reveals the burnt, the blunt
The obtuse truth
Give me anything but such a sign
I've no language left for you

    





A Painting Tells More Than You'll Know

A canvas is a conscious thing
Which holds no lies but hands with truth
Just try and hide from a single strike
A single stroke of brush to be
Once there it will never be without again
Once aware you'll never unsee the colors again
This is the nature of paint
Or at least one of its many mothers
See?

    





Apartment Envy

The meadowtails know your shoes
So well
They think your walk a world
But in your absence
The earth is turned
And on its apartment head resides
My walls awaiting your eyes
Greedily as they
Are sick of me and yearn only for you
Your wild lights bring them back
And ever into focus
Alive

    





A Perfectly Executed Problem

If you could just see me when I'm alone
You might just fall in love me
The only problem is
That I don't let anyone see ME
When I'm alone

    





A Personal Thing

All of the hopeful desires to be 
Cannot be 
When I see you there 
And in the future unseen
See

    





A Pleasurable Reticent Echo

I’m not sure which is more pleasurable

      The last ounce of sugar on my tongue 
      The echo unsung 
      Or the quiet words in perfect unison

Sung, a most capable accompaniment 
The kind which doesn’t make me feel alone 

In the silence of a broken room 
Your song sings words to the reticent me 

Make me feel both old and new

    





Apocalypse

It was better before the stars burned out

Before the clouds dispersed and deserted our dreams

Before the oceans turned

It was better then

When you could dance in the rain and hear yourself

Before the mountainous trees had all burned down

And the gas clouds escaped the hollowed ground

When your mother and I would walk the earth

And sing until the words fell out of our open mouths

It was a different place to live and be

It was different world than what we know now

    





Appearance Below

Looking at an author

It’s in the cheekbones
Below the eyes
Beneath the subtle shades of truth
It lies
To hide the self
Hiding itself
Yet worlds
Worlds are presented as such
So as to think
That they reside inside

And sometimes they do

    





April Jazz

You are snowflakes dancing in the draft of winter 
Upwards and yet with all the warmth and kindness of the hands behind the window 

You are springtime in December
Let me climb my way through you into the coolness of an April day for just a moment or two

    





A Prismal Haiku

Artists live as prisms
Captivated and thus torn
By the light through them

    





A Punch

The feeling of looking forward
Is the strongest drug 
Which doesn’t require moving 
Anywhere at all

    





A Question

What if my tongue
Parched from its boredom
Runs out of ink
Or forgets itself
And the ways of penning graphite scenes
Into the reality of lines to be
?

What if my of
Has come forth only to be 
Nothing more than a habitus 
Or self reflective mirror
That worships either everything of self
Or of thee
?

What if our cause
Was already free
And found beside a quiet setting
Where the Idaho deer
Meet, paw, and breed their joys 
Dispite of inequities 
?

What if this
All the snow in heaven fell
And all the heat of hell rose up
And all the steam between were trees
And you were me
And we were these
?

What if is all I ask of me
?

    





A Question of Conscious Action

There are thing you must do
And you'll always know, exactly why

And on the other side 
Of the same wall

There will be residual things 
Ever new to you

And the reasons for which 
You will probably guess at

Though you may never know 
Must you learn to abide?

    





A quiet man sits amongst the crowds

Somedays I sit
And feel strongly that
Pages hear me far better
Than any one person ever has

(And they wonder why I like to sit)

    





A Rally

Tennis is like poetry

Back ... and ... forth
And back ... and ... forth
Back ... and ... forth
And back ... and ... forth
Back ... and ... forth
And back ... and ... forth

Until one line breaks

    





A Real Smile From Me

The smile which brings these crows to my face
Is owned by something else this day
A name, a name
A beautiful name 
How it brings a smile to my face
A smile so loud, it would scare all other birds away
But not the crows feet in this place

    





Are Stars

Do the stars know that they're far 
Or do they think that falling is just warm 
In love with the friction of an attractive atmosphere
How they wish to plunge into our wishful sight
Like a rippling rock or a wavering tree
No stars are not afraid of being seen 
If anything sought out in both sky and sight 
As the most truthful of stars, ever been
Have and are smiling 
From an insatiable height

    





Are We Strangers Now?

The most honest question a man can ask, like rock and roll and the radio, was our kind of love, the kind which lasts?

    





A riddle

Give me too much
Until little it takes 
And I'll be wasting away
In a field of either unthought or none
No pace to set or mind to bind 
There is nothing of theirs 
In this most unkind form of lost

    





Arise My Heart, Away

Neither burst
  Nor chains 
    Will break this marrow cage

Nor sun
  Anew 
    Will not change my ways 

Arise my heart 
   Alive today 
     Arise my heart, away

    





Aroma

There are girls who smell like spring...

And there are girls who smell like books...

And there are girls who paint a trace along the lines of your own family.

Which are most to be avoided.

    





Arrogance

A turn of the torso in the hall
          Be it to look back or forward
          Past or beyond the past
          Is not necessarily wrong at all
</em>Unless of course the owner of the turn
          Is twisting therein arrogance
          Or with an unsettling voice
          Which demeans all others in the hall 
</em>But if such a twisting diaphragm can actually sing
          Then arrogance is more all the more tolerable
          And not so much a problem at all
</em>Because the sound will be beautiful*
          Even if the character is not beautiful at all

    





Arrogant

When I see this
When I hear that 
And when I am most hallowed out 
The arrogant side of me saunters in 
And quietly says, something boisterous and aloud 
“Let me show you just how I can be“</em>
It says most confidently 
And yet I wonder those words 
And if my arrogance also says such things to me

    





Arrowhead

Though I dig the arrow out of my chest 
The metallic breath remains in me
Breathing slowly with inward beat
And never still 
At least in mind and memory

    





Arrows

I am fire. 
I am fury. 
I am explosions in the sky. 

For now at least. 
For as surely as the sun will rise, my short lived ignitive spark will fly, off into the nothingness of space and time. 

Eternity. 

And only the memory will remain. 
Until that too dies. 
First and foremost with me. 

I am the arrows which once did fly, directly into the hearts of the king's enemies.

    





Arrows In The Night Sky

Writers are those who bend their bows
Shooting arrows into the night sky
Hoping almost to hit
But not yet ****
The stars

    





Arsène Lupin III

The wolfing theif who howls aloud
A ravenous young man with just the essence of beast
Who wears the forest on his back
Who dashes down the rooftop steep
Just to bridge the gap from far away
And land, ever so slightly on the precipice sway
Just to reach up gently and pocket the moon
As a souvenir to take upon his way

    





A runner without garden

A world of responsibilities 
Around a round
And all I want to do it run
To the end of the lane unending and long 

No excuse is youth
I've grown

    





As All True Friends Do

Real friends know who you are. And they don't take offense at you being you. They just account for it. See title.

    





A Scottish Stranger

If you ever loaned your eyes 
To where such words have been leading these thoughts of mine
Ever sacrificed a second for this side of my discovery
Then 
I just want to say THANK YOU
Dearest unco stranger of you
For witnessing this revision of me
Yes, please
(:

    





A seasonal question

How do you walk
After flying so far
?

Or be 
After the feeling of un is all
?

How 
How 
How
I ask

Do you find peace again
After the summer ends
?

In Fall
?

    





A Setting Son

Its shoulders back
And back bent 
Until time breaks will
And perpectives are know

It is more than talk
Or act or deed alone
It is more than anything 
Which could ever be

It is trust and in trust
It is faith within hope
It is family over honor
Facing known and unknown

And in due time 
It is the requirement
That both father and son are willing
To let go

    





A Shadowy Tanka

No more shadows reign
No more the dark running waves
For they have crashed, yes
And will pass inquisitive
As no darker means will last

    





A Shared Cup

This feeling isn't my own perhaps
But imparted to me in part by you
The way the words just wouldn't last
The foiled hours which ran me through

I walked and spoke
You sat and sang
To each our own in tune and life

And yet the feeling permeates 
And makes me sip another drip

To share like that another life

    





A Shared Thought

I wonder if she 
Thinks about this</em>
As much as I do? 
Herself being
Of course 
Who she is
It's possible 
That she does
Just as I do

    





Ashes And Dirt

Expect not yourself
To see the world
For the way it truly is
At least at first

Because the world is full of so many things
And people who are ever changing

And the truth behind it all is this

*That one day all of these and we 
Will be returned to the earth
Returned to the dirt
Or ashes depending upon the preference

    





a short most human question of sorts (unsorted)

the most human question in the ever, is not how ... but why?

    





AS ICE

The night won’t look the same
        It hasn’t since 
You up and walked the stars into another man’s cave
        Where your flames embrace
        A future warm without 
        The same old sky of me 
So cold

    





A sight

I love the reflected sheen of light
Which glows and grows off of floors unclean 
And creates horizons unhigh 

My eyes know these sights most well
And like them most ardently 

This censor of mine, alone

    





A Sight

On the days when I 
Am aware and awake 
And in balance with the world 
From each stream to each oceans lake

I swear noone else can contest my sight
Or explain my innate insight 
Or see the light as my eyes perceive

Where shadows meet 
Both the man-made eaves and the un

I am there in feeling just beyond the chest

It was always me

    





A Simple Cup

Having to have made myself
And by myself all too often alone
Making
I'll know its love
When she makes me coffee
And I dont even see her coming
But with a smile
Bringing

    





A Single Man's Remind

Cold meat, processed cheese, making my lunch for another day* 
Rolled up sleeves</em>
Empty sheets</em>
No one in my bed to sleep with anyway</em>

And at work I find no reward to adore, and after driving home</em> 
I cannot help but work some more</em>
Mostly favors of art because I'm poor</em>

Yet no matter how busy I like to keep</em>
I always manage to find some time</em>
To stray into topics too often, too deep</em>
Like what it would be like to be with her in mind</em>

Though most every night I see my brothers, whisk their brides to be away</em>
*It's with every dawn that I am reminded, that my life will not always be this way

    





A Single Rain Drop

No rain has left my eyes like this
For many present days

No water puddling beneath
No need for mist

But today...
Today one raindrop fell to my right

And for the life of me
I couldn't wish it away

    





A Single Strand

Ours is like a strand of yarn
Stretched across a narrow gap
Though the wind berates
And the rain pours out in the summer storm
It will not break, it will endure
But perhaps in time will sag and fray
As if we let it so to go
Or even chose to cut it down
Because you have your own phone lines now
Made of woven steel and unbroken arms
As we were just a childhood yarn
Or a single strand between two hearts

    





As It Is

Dont waste a moment 
A precious breath
On a dream which long since
Stopped breathing

You are not dead

    





Ask

What doors are you afraid of walking through?
For fear of the family and following to come?

    





Ask Hush

Dear Hush, 
What is a movie which I must, 
See and such?
Something idealistic,
And not so hush hush.
If you'd tell me in a minute,
I'd appreciate it much,
I appreciate your time,
O' Misses o' Hush.

    





As Long As I Wait For You, This Is Home

My heart calls out 
Across miles of the inhabited found 
By those who cannot hear 
Living peacefully in something-towns 

For its by our sounds 
That I wait for you 
Like dust on the rails 
Like anxious feet on walking trails untouched 

I am waiting for you 
Like Christmas snow
On the morning birth celebrated anew 
Come home 

Would you tell me my one whisper true?

    





A Smile From Last Week

Have you any idea? 
What you do to my eyes?
The wrinkles and lines which you evoke?  
With delicate ease…
You do this to me
And have you any idea?

    





A Soft Rain

Let the morning rain fall 
And pat your head 
As softly as if I were there

    





A Song A Sound Tanka

Your sound here in ears
Is peaks and valleys out west
In this eastern world
Hear the Allegheny sky
I'm myself, a wishing song

    





A Song In The Air

I’d paint every leaf back
Pluck every vibrato piece of string 
Catch a falling star enroute to earth 
And cut Newfoundland fog 
Just to hear the same old song once sang

    





A Song of Memory

When I hear the song we once did share
Echoing though the woods of now

And bouncing off of the realizations
Of how we both cared then and now
 
It is here I find that I'm young again
Be it only in mind and consequence

Let not a wish be defined by when
But know this of this aged man

That the ending doesn't seem to stop
Me hearing that same old song again

    





A Song To Self

My eyes get intense 
The echoes bounce 
But no one complains
Because no one sees
Me

And when no one sees 
The enthused sight
It results 
In an even happier 
Me

    





A Soundness Before The Still

My echo 
My desire to be heard
Died long ago

In a notebook winding longer than the build before the great crescendo

And I noted in this
As a young man of old
As a conductor of sorts 

Not attempting to refire all of the old songs turned cold 
No
But rewriting them each for me alone 
Indefinitely and until the long silence comes home

    





A Southern Style Cocktail

It's a cocktail in which memory mixes with sensation and sound. To become even moreso drunk on you. In the remind of those moments once shared, in that certain, southern, American town.

    





A Speeding Sprite

I run through rivers
And pull down lightning from the sky
Like fire and smoke 

With a mystic bliss, here
Mist spraying and forever
Fog and strike, there

Stand by and watch for hope
For I am the air itself beneath
And everywhere I fly and then

My lightness becomes the talk
Like paper edges fresh and sharp
In the histories of men

    





Aspirations

Aspiring 
     To hope for you less
     To pray for you more 
And…
     To take your name off the page that hangs
     Politely behind my former door 
Aspiring is the word once more

    





A Star Entering Loves Atmosphere

I love the Stars
Cold and distant burning warm on approaching day
Darker than the lover's heart once torn apart until the newfound comes 
And ways present themselves

And in falling
Streaks across the sky proclaiming love of our atmosphere
With a tale of residue tagging along and just behind it's former way of life

And in our eyes seeing
A sparkle alive in this familiar, love found, way

A star entering loves atmosphere
Is what I see in the dawn of this new day

    





Asteticly

Walk through my life without me
And see
All that your eyes could partake of
And still 
I wouldn't be scared for either of us
Because 
My voice speaks louder asteticly
Therein 
And within resides my will

    





A Stoningland Prayer

Tall tower of Ecthelion
White tree of Númenor
Crash not over me with tidal waves
But restore the trust
The peace perceived and the strength of men
As it was before between the earth
During the younger days
When the sunlight was bright with gleaming eyes

    





A Storm Colored Tanka

Dark clouds cover cold 
Golden hay shines like the Sun
And colors become
One with the grey eternal 
A flood of song into one

    





A Struggling Lover

How I wish my sorrow wasn't here but would be 
In any breath of existence warm 
Beating as a distant drum 
Humming as a harp or lyre
A wish is not enough to start 
Or to turn a fog into valleys below 
And yet as a sunrise my hope so begins 
In a directional dream wondering where they will go and what we will be
In a chaotic order once again to see the somber thought therein

    





A Suitor Named Sunshine (A Tanka)

Doves coo a quiet
And whisper softly to her
That they've seen'em thee
The suitor suns inquiry
Of her eccentricities

    





A Sword Named Order

Dear chaos heart
Die on the edge of my orderly blade 
And bleed out your malevolence
Forever depart

    





As Worlds Crave Worlds

Because you are
         A whole universe is
         I am addicted to you
Because I am

    





As You Are

The expression you are as you say you are</em> is not true if you actually are not</em> as you say you are.

    





A Tanka About Her Curly Hair (S7)

Evident, conscious 
Are your curls aware of me?
As I am captured 
By a gentle turning lock
A wave in the subtle trees

    





A Tanka For A Beautiful Hillside

As eyes see surely
Blue lylac on a green hill
Wavering with ease
So also these yellow sails
Grace the white canvas born free

    





A Tanka For A Snowy Spring Day

Foolish to revive
Anew on an April's day
Stormy sentiments
Devoid of such rainy eyes
But full of such snowy woes

    





A Tanka For Her Daughters

Listen to the sky
</em>To her daughter as they run
</em>And play mold the earth
</em>With waters and stirring clay
</em>Do her rivers run alive

    





A Tanka For Her Summer Description

In August a breeze 
You are enraptured and free
Like hills clouded skies
Like stars in deepest oceans
And like rain in Auburn eyes

    





A Tanka For Her Tired Eyes

Curl up in my bed 
Do not wait for me to sleep
Dim the lights slightly
And when I return to you
Wrap your sleepy arms round me

    





A Tanka For How I Hope I'd Respond

Uncomfortable
Be it called by my own name
I must reply now
Not in haste or anger still
But in active truth most kind

    





A Tanka For Shy People, Wandering Minds and Anxious Askers

Though hours of silence
May stand still between two hearts
There's nothing between
Your chances and your own hope
With opportunistic eyes

    





A Tanka For The Head And Heart Song

Two heart-strong lovers 
Unknown to one another
Except really 
In the realm of self within
And the sharing of begin

    





A Tanka For The Tired Rain Soaked Soul

Your clouds need not seek 
Just as shadows need not flee
From the falling rain
All that a running soul needs
Is to in acceptance be

    





A Tanka Promised Every Morn (S7)

Look up like new day
Even in darkness before
Just as a promise
Holds no heat without fervence
So soon your sun warmth is born

    





A Taste

Noone wants filet minion 
Everyday
And if they do they don't have it

Envy is an occasional thing
Whereas the truth is much more real
And substantial

    





A Thirsty Earth, A Haiku

A twist of cloud zest
Looking up into sky glass
Perhaps the earth drinks?

    





A Thought

A Thought

Is not a word

Is not a will

Is not a sky

But a man

A man is a man

A woman is a woman

A you is you

An I is I

    





A Thoughtful Heart

A thoughtful heart
   Wishes for a quiet corner
And thinks 
   Not for the potential being or un
But for others warm
   And their tired feet
Though they may never meet
   The intent is pure
And purely kind

    





A Thousand Times Whispered Before

Whispering into an envelope 
It is sealed and slipped under your door 
A small gift of song
An imperfect thing
Quiet and unassuming between ears
A sound which I’ve had and heard a thousand times before
And more and more
As it becomes
And in becoming yours

    





A Throbbing Heart

It is a heartthrob’s way
To say
“I’d rather have noone than to not have you”
When really
The truth is
That unless the other person
Wants you too
Then you're just spending time
On a beach by yourself
Watching the waves crash on by
Never surfing yourself
What is life?
If not lived
While you still have your health?
It is a heartthrob’s way
So I say
Nothing else

    





A Tired Heartbeat

I am both here and nowhere 
Inside these words and out 
Lost in a questioning, wondering, how 
To be free of something that will be
To be like snow and water and cloud
To be a bit more of a pragmatist free
To be something un
Somethint that isn't all about me 
Preferably now

    





At Least On This Earth

When the newness wears off
And the distraction is no longer distracting enough 
Where will you go?
In order to be reminded
That you are not alone?

    





A Train Named Tomorrow

Tomorrow is coming, like a train of iron on a track of steel and nothing can stop it.  Nothing that is or ever will be derailed. Tomorrow is coming between friction and steel.

    





Attempt

If I vanish 
If I fly 
And do not return to such a height 
Know me here
And that I tried 
Endlessly to express the un at the edge of life

    





At The Base

I'd travel to the most secluded meadow.
The last one before the mountain steeps and the trees die out amongst the rocks.
Not to swim in the lake or the lesser pond.
But to pull a single flower for you.
What else could exemplify this?
The rarity of your beauty to me?

    





At The Edge Of A Clearing

I always wanted to work in a place
Where if it surpasses me
I could walk out of an open door, into the woods 
And walk away from everything
Until I am surrounded by trees 
And so I am, surrounded by trees 
Away from that place and all that it means 
Because walking is part of a walking life 
And no shoelace ever remains fully tied

    





At The Edge Of The Clearing

Nestled
Within the crackle of a fire 

Whispered 
In the voices of the wind

Resting 
Just beyond the nights first desire 

Dawning 
Outside the morning and it’s halo ring

    





At The Edge Of The Sea

Pick the lock on this old heart
Would you?
I've thrown away the key

Into the foam
Where the towers fall
Just over the edge of this most dramatic me

Would you batter it down
The old barred door
Let the oak tides crash for an eternity

As you hear the churning waking sea
So it consumes the sound
Of a splashing key

    





At The End Of All Focus

Tear me away from this society
From this company
From these smiles that are not mine
And will not keep

Give me a flower
Give me a tree
A shining steeple that grows till death
And shimmers in the sun
Stedily, radiantly

    





At The End Of All Things

One day you'll look at yourself 
And see a stranger staring back 
In wonderment and awe no more 
You there, reborn, will see yourself upon arrival 
Having finally reached at last, the last

    





AT THE END OF ALL WORDs

when doubt turns back
from gray to blueish hue 
the earth itself stops son from spinning
and in directional ways found 
bounds down like fog over the mountains
(anew)

turns on its end like the books overthrown
by shifting night and confusing gloom
you were there and saw 
the night when it first went missing
(the moon)

and if anyone besides me heard it first 
(it was you)

Cackling above the trees like a crow
Above the earth 
(which will not grow)

the look beyond
which turns away 
is there
(at the end of all our exploring)

    





At The End Of Each Day

Quiet is the honest whisper
When all the distractions are at an end

When your head hits the pillow
Your heart hits your ribs
And your mind's eye opens
To these inevitable ends

How we seek to wear ourselves so thin
How we think the future is better than
This present moment known to you

But the quiet whisper knows no lie
The honest whisper knows the truth

    





At The End Of The Night

Like an alarm clock from the old oak cabin
I wind and wait for you to find 

Like a night of rest in which myself
Is nowhere to be found

Like a wishful sigh which dies out slow
As the noise is consumed by the town 

So no words are like this, ever enough for me
To express my wingding down

Like a burst of grape in the eager mouth
So a sound it last is out 

For the Like in me has not gone away 
So much as just been pushed around, haha.

    





At The End Of The Yearlong Road

When I'm There

After all of the noise
Of all the days
Of the all time spent prior

When I'm there

All that's left is silence
All that's left is the sound of the wind as it breathes
Through the spheric nature of me

    





At The Stars Which Reach

All the heavens reach 
And with starry eyes exclaim
Envy as his feeling

    





A Turning Clock

I snap my fingers in a crowded room
Call out quietly to the one of you
And wait patiently for fate to turn
For the clock chimes to unwind
And ruminate aloud 

Will your song give me a chance to hear
My words to speak

    





August 21st, 2017

You — And your quiet glow — Make me feel like a serene ripple. Like a blessed wish on a prior day.

You — And all that every human eye has seen — Scatter rippling white lights, all across this distant horizon of me.

May the shadow of the this glorious moon fall gently on a world of peace.

    





August Glade

Through the rivers and the rain
   My emotions seep 

No matter how far I reach
   How quiet I be
      Or how fervently I wish 
      For this condensated heart to dry 

Beneath stars and moonlight vain 
   I stay 
      Locked in the garden of perpetual being 
         Without your warmth of certain meaning 

And when the new morning comes 
   With the quiet thought 
      I realize what I had always ought 

That I cannot seem to make you mine
   Regardless of the place or time

    





Autumn Shoreline

My heart sinks slowly
  In sand and saltwater 

Not washed away 
  But picked at slowly
    By this watery grave 

And with every crashing moment hence
  I feel the immense pull of the earth 

Reaching down I feel
  The fall of memories
    Rushing over me in waves

    





A Vision

I've been having this dream
These visions of lovers in each others arms
One always looking down lovingly on the other 

Wrapped up in a world known only to them
To escape the old days which are fading away
Looking outwardly in

Some of which, are located at the place where old memories begin
But only one side can see
The exact detail of such fond memories

For to sleep in the arms of another companion
Is to forget that they 
May have been wide awake

And to hold with these 
Be it both sets of arms 
Two lovers it takes from each in part

    





A Visitor Who Thought About You

Remember the time I stopped by your town
Just to sit myself down and think about you?

Where you were
What you meant 
What you thought
And if you knew or wanted to know 

Of me and where I was
My thoughts or what for me
(rang out eternal and true)

No, in retrospect
I remember the time I went to your town
I remember it now and yet you never knew

    





A Voiceful Tanka

Quiet voices call
Another restful mind's eye
To see as others
Be as being cannot call
And remind if quiet lives

    





Awakening

We want to dream
Because we think
That dreams will give us meaning

But when we wake 
And see the day
No dream was worth believing 

The only thing 
That matters still
Awaits upon awaking

Because nothing
Added ere by dreams
Will ever be for keeping

    





Aware, Aware

In time, imperfect being knows itself at such
And still accepts that it is
And isn't so much
That which is immediately wanted and more
For all could become in time, in time
So much more than that we ever were before

    





Awareless

You let yourself become what you are
These feelings are not you

    





Awareness

When someone speaks, I am not me,
I am there

And when I speak, sometimes, I am not there also

So when quiet, my first love, comes around

And the silence coats me like a fog

And falls on me like a blanket of down

I am at my ease, I am there at peace

For I am nowhere at last

All the noises have ceased

I am not aloud

    





Awash

All the small little bobbles of humanity
Are but stones settling in the sea
Sinking down
When I am awash in the sea of voices at Calvary
Cresting on hope
I float

    





A Well Known Place

Thin like the willow
Grey as the dove

Quiet as the wind beneath which pesters the cat floats the wings and sweeps the city streets clean of debris 

Dark as the asphalt
Soft as the paws

Lean like meat
Old like soil
And slick like oil as it drips from beneath 

Shaking like the bedrock
The running water whips 

Damp as the corners 
And dry as your eyes
It slips

And where asphalt meets the mossgrown bricks
Corners are placed and worlds collide

And the man within is locked away
Within the metaphorical city street

Would the Central Park I know and love, return to me?
In all such glory

The Willow trees

    





A Wentworth

Not Mary, never Elizabeth
My Anne Elliot
Marry me
Why do you tarry
Especially when I'm not longer at sea

    





A Window In Rivendell

With armchair oceans
Window territories
And cavernous vaults beneath wooden beach
Oak and timber, rock and stone
Stretched out in the cold of winter contained
Find a new home for your quiet feet
And in months, when spring born summer ends
Fall back into the ease of a rustling sleep
With the choice to never begin
Beneath a canvas of life
Which keeps growing and falling 
Ever onward and over again

    





A Window Into The Wood

Bright and cheery as the sunlit gleam off the seasoned leaves
With peaks as high as the surrounding sound
And yet as approachable as the dawn which streams
Into the Meadow of the long lost wood
Where every childhood memory can be found
Pure is the light which envelopes these scenes
And pouring out is the heartfullness of each and every noted sound

    





A Winter Rose

Human beings grow and grow
Until we don't 
And won't 

Outside of nature
We are not trees
Just as every winter will consume the rose

We bud where and when and with whom we please

    





A winter rose, a pair of haikus

Listen to the snow
Rising, sweeping across this
Hallow winter rose

No flower ever
Sees to live in fields of white
Let alone let's grow

    





A Wish From My Fading Day

With the last ounce of daylight
   A quiet wish takes flight

Like the beating wings of dragon flies
   Faster than a heart can hold
   Clearer than a clouded sky
   With dusklit distant humming hues

Here is the wish intent on finding you
   Wherever you are in this storied eye

I cannot see you 
   Though I wish
   (To find)

    





A Wish Granted, A Tanka

Going nowhere is
Is still being here, something
Be it time to pass 
Anew, whatever else you 
Wished for on this burning gas

    





A wish in the form of a distant tanka

Wish myself upon 
A distant hillside growing 
Though in no ways near
I am in showing myself
For a desire to be there

    





A Wish Is All This Man Can Give (11:12)

I miss you like the December earth 
      Misses the sunlit rays on a cloudy day 
Cold for you I yearn each dawn
      And churn and burn as the aching Pacific waves 
A crashing hope upon wishes bent
      At 11:12 my world set straight  
And all that a man can do is wish
      That this will be the fated day 
You walk into my life 
      And stay

    





A Wish Not For Himself

For all the water which poured out slow
And was wasted on such hollow words
I should not wish for myself at least
I should not waste
I should wish for her

    





A Wooded Childhood

It's sanded pine
Near endless time
And summers spent on nothing at all
An investment there in the gracious fade
Of seasons without age
And a blending of being
In with the trees which seek to cover all

And so it remains in my memory min
And in the ambitiousness of man
Which knowins no end
And so its been it's been
Until the circle if we begins again

    





A Word Can Only Travel So Far

What good are my admirations?
Although inherently good they maybe.
What good are they, at present, to me?

    





A Workers Omission

When did I let this vocation of mine?
Which I've worked so hard for
Become the main reason and meaning of me?

When exactly did it happen
That my passion slipped and fell to the ground
Like the seasons passing on an endless tree?

I said I wouldn't forget once I had 
I said many things of myself back then
Be it most confident or most arrogantly

A vow is a vow to those who uphold
But what are the words to the man within?
Who forgets himself in his own externalties

    





A Year Stolen From Ourselves

Yearning for the hours free
But once set upon
By the all too present moment 
Found
You may wish yourself 
Back
To the time before a viral wish broke out
So be careful of your wishes now

    





Babble

Get out of my ears
With your endless babble
I'm trying to hear my future thoughts into being

Just a step beyond community

    





Back To Back

There is no darker side of the room
There is no air left in to breathe
There is no light, there is no sound
When left alone with such feeling as these 

Because

When one person feels
But the other doesn't 
There is only darkness
Back to back

And the silence therein in between

    





Banished Shwdow Eyes

I hate the morning
Love the shadow eyes
So much
That I often forget to 
To see the light of day
How bright it is
To feel 
Amazed

    





Banishing Clouds

Like a spotlight on an empty stage
So the clouds part ways with their Ominous hopes
Separating themselves from truth
They wish to whisk my joy away
They wish to banish me to the darkest corners of a shadowy grey
To someplace where there is a more active role which they can play
And yet today is not such a day
For the shadowy clouds which I abhor have been whisked away 
And hence forth they shall hang over my head no more
When the light of my life has pierced their veil and come to pass
I shall dance around the darkened clouds like a matador 
Let not the darkness overhead **** the candor which self-pity abhors

    





Bare Chest

Scars are always
Far more practical than 
Found out never and nearly 
As romantic or poignant 
As initally portrayed

    





Bartender Mike

The world's OK, it's the people that spoil it.

    





Basking in the reflective sea (Lines of 7 AND)

Love this timeless feeling free.
Within the ebb and flowing
conscious world of unknowing.

Here in memories showing.
All of the reflective be
Brought within this common wave

Which cannot help but steady
It’s deep sky clear as daylight
Crashing nighttime off staved off

AND

All is water here my friend
When that is let go within
This all-encompassing sea

    





Battlefield

The day it's easy
To convey such depth
Is the invested day
Vested far beyond this
And is fiercely won

    





Be (a look into the future)

I want to be able to say
That I saw you not as you were
But as you could be
As you will be, and would be
That is of course
Only if you desire to be

    





Beautiful Girl

There is beauty in the meadow, 
In the trees and in the sky. 
There is beauty in her hair, 
And in her lavished auburn eyes.

There is beauty in the summer, 
There is beauty in the fall. 
And there is beauty in her manner, 
And her voice with which she calls.

For there is beauty all around us, 
And there is beauty to be found, 
And yet the beauty which I seek, 
Is not so visibly abound.

It is a beautiful enticement. 
A clever thought revealed in time. 
For what I want is beyond vision, 
And what I seek is within mind.

-SS

    





Beautiful Irony

Is it ironic that I returned Mr Frost only when the snow first began to fall? 

Yes I would say, that's hilarious. And an obvious irony she would call.

Like a sunset fading in the west, much like her favorite day of all.  

It appears to me on such a day. What a beautiful irony for all. 

How humerous is it that she loves Frost, even though it must destroy the Fall.

As a pedestrian I walk towards winter, across the bricks which they call mall. 

With a chuckle and a quiet tone, my words pretend to be appalled.

And all I can do is shake my head, at this beautiful irony for all.

    





Beautiful Rememberence

Trapped is not a possible feeling
When you're found in the sound
Of the rain falling out
Of the sky amidst the summers cry

When you're full and brimming as the dawn
With contemplative thought
And your stomach is quenched
Your mind alive with the memory of trees unbent

Quiet as the flooding stream
Noisy as the Red Winged Blackbird
As it pecks and cackles at the Sparrows hence
Until no more can be seen

Such impossible feelings and thoughts as these
Are but a mist in the morning
Are no more disturbing
Than the raindrops rippling on a pond serene

    





Beauty

Beauty is not a belief 
But a streaming reflection 
Growing and widening into a river 
And ultimately the sea
Or at least so your flowing has been
Seen

    





Because She Is

There’s an emptiness about it
Just words on a page
Just thoughts on a screen
And nothing more

Although there was a time, when I really let myself hope
I’ve kind of moved beyond that
Although she is as beautiful as the sun, the moon or any sort of imagery I could depict 
I know that it’s not for me to see
Her footprints are in front of me
Moving out into the darkness of this good night 

You just know some times, because…
You try, and live and breathe, and get up every day and, try again
But some things no matter how hard you try, just aren’t meant to be
You can’t even ask for them
She is one such thing

I’m really thankful for her, and I don’t tell her but…she’s often on my mind

I wish I knew her
Better than I know my own mind and my own person
Because she is 
Not just worth knowing, but worth memorizing and understanding

Time and time again
Because she is

    





Becoming

Hello again never, 
     Did you ever know this little truth?</em> 
          That part of who I am, 
               <strong>Becoming,</strong> 
                    Always is and will be, 
                         For you?

    





Becoming Life A Shimmer

I am sunset rivershine. Holding onto the final fragments of the young moon fallen, and the starlight smile given quietly, free. In the passing lane of time, accelerating towards truth. Forward as I may be, at this present time. It's nice to know, that I'm not yet, or at least fully, through.

    





Becoming Lighting

I used to be thunderous
In all ears and a roar
But now I'm like lighting instead
And when I strike
There is only a sudden flash of light
As a stroke of fire appears before
Instantly born
Where the static clouds meet the metal earth
I am timing incumbet, electric incarnate
And as my will touches down
My foes are torn

    





Before My Eyes

This is the creature which commands my heart?
Which demands my respect and defines my reasons,
For which I refuse to depart?  

This creature in front of me.

What must I try,
Or even ask why?  

Is it a need to impress upon the rest?
That I was I, 
Or that she was somehow best for me?

For I have since gone on to see, 
That she is but a creature, 
And that I am but a small shard of humanity. 

Is there proof of this,
Which I have missed? 
Quite possibly. 

Or am I somehow immune to the truth, 
That I am the only one who sees, 
Or that my soul alone is the one which pleads,
To be apprciated?

Would you tell me this?

Or is life just meant to be,
A bitter tasting hollow test which I must best, 
In a single man’s own exclusivity?

Why must I define such a simple thing? 
Why can we not just coincide with empathy?
 
But to say that joy and empathy are the same,
Is nothing more than a lie to me.

Only recently have I begun to understand, 
That I must stand,
Alongside a girl who is not the result of a lesser man.

One who knows the self and serves not pride. 
Show me such a creature before my eyes, 
And my heart will fly.

    





Before you fall asleep

Just a look is all it takes to keep
My mind from drifting off again
Into what promises tell me
And yet my heart knows not will be
An eternal sleep 

Just a second alone
With those eyes of yours will find 
Within me burning like a freshly struck match
A fire so humble and a wisp so keen
To been seen for an instant more longer than sleep 

Just to tarry with you here, my love,
Is beyond that of the summer afternoon dreams

    





Beginning To Walk

Write me in as I would of you
And stumbling onward
We walk

Converse with me as the trees speak to trees
And our whispers will grow in full
As we talk

    





Behind Closed Doors

It's down the hallway, 
Hovering just above the tile floor. 
It's wallowing in the wake of the last man's grown mistake. 
Because you cannot see the quiet struggles behind closed doors.

    





Behind The Curtain

In issues of the tongue and heart
One thought resolves 
(all others)

Parting mind from misery 
Fog from fine


And that is here
Regarding all decisions there
(within) 

The real question is not of what, or why
But of when did the notion begin?

    





Behind The Eyes

A man can only write as much as what he holds behind his eyes
And if you were the last sight to see
I can guarantee that you needn't be surprised 
If he runs away from such of sight, occasionally

Because the expression is either all about you or nothing at all
There is no in between such things
No inner lining between the eye and the mind 
Of what a man has always seen, in you

There is just the wall in front of him
The key to turn, and the inanimate door to find
Don't take it personally
But a man can only write as much of what he holds behind his eyes

    





Behind The Windows And The World (A Tanka)

Caught mid a breath as 
I escaping metaphor
Ic fly my needs 
An I to open windows 
Cold to feel what is in between

    





Behind Twinkling Eyes

The secret of an old man’s eyes
Is not what they look upon
Or how they shine
But what they see behind

    





Being Is Not Something We Do

A wish is just the absence of a realization.

Just as the night is just the absence of the sun, which ignites our minds to breathe.

Just as I wish that I'd realized this sooner.

Yes, even I am susceptible to life itself.

Espdcially me.

    





Be Like Water And Storm

Crosshatched in the sky

The stalling rain

Which cannot decide to be snow or not

Iconicised

In the eyes of me

Just as you'll always remember the last time

The moment before you smile and flee

Into the new storms eye

Good endings don't always metastasise

But water always begins again

And evaporates most every time

You don't have to be more than you've ever been

All you have to do is try

    





Bending Time and Song

I wish that time itself
Were a different meaning
A commodity I could bend and turn
Into a completely different existence being
And in nonsense found
The most sensible singers
Pleading to be heard again, together and
In such looks there can only be the one understandable meaning meant
You glance is haunting
And our seeing is what leads me to be
What nudges me towards believing

    





Beneath Moonlit Clouds

Ask to find. Don't run and hide. 
The person is not the pleasure which is in mind.

Just as fears are never lasting, ever fading fast we die.

So also should our conversations be more just than that in mind.

And yet I find...

That it is the pride of self expression, which comes most before the fall.

Perhaps our story has been recanted. And I did not share Me at all?

    





Beneath St. Elmo’s Fire

Let it go
Release your hold
Lie back at sea 
And be 

Turn your eyes 
Up to the sky
Into the fire
Stare back, daringly 

Cover not
Your wavering life 
Of the underneath 
Be free

For all is heaven
All is earth
And all around
Is all to see 

Open your hands
To grasp no more 
Open your mind
To stars ablaze 

Let night consume 
Your morning plans 
Let waters wash 
All fear away 

Let first your thought
Be not of me 
Not of yourself
But all of these 

For all is heaven
And all is earth
And all around
Is all to see

    





Beneath The Irish Sun Alive

I used to run across the Moherian cliffs
And jump to catch the first sunlight nether wisps 
As they twinkled like dawning fireflies shone 
In the jar of a hopeful wish
For as just as in your hand there mine own exists 
Con·tent·edly

    





Beneath The Trees

There is a forest near to me 
Be it a wooded way within my heart
Which I often wish that you could see
And stand beside me here beneath 
These ancient trees
That way no photo I would need
To share its likeness in such a way
As to create certain a memory 
And even then if you’re not within 
Such a settling scene 
I would make it still
Because you simply have to see
The way these ancient roots run deep 
And dig into the empty earth
The way that there is a sea of green 
Perched just above the best of me 
Like a consortium of ill doomed leaves 
Which will fall without fail after every summer 
And perhaps this year
They will land upon us both for once 
As we stand beside here amongst the leaves 
Just you and me
Beneath the trees

    





Beneath the willow unified

The willow strands fall gently down
And sway in unseen breezes felt
Such humming souls among the bees
In awe like stars, awash like waves 
And beneath like clouded warmth about
They breathe their breath both in and out
The cooling trusting reflective earth
Which grows and grows beneath the feet
Around such mortal feelings felt
An embrace as such is heavens grace
I wish I want when we're without

    





Be Still My Wishful Failure Of A Heart [at seeing you]

I told my heartbeat not to beat
To hold its breath in quietness 
And keep its chest in evenness 
I told my heartbeat not to beat
And yet it has betrayed me still
By not being even but in a mess 

[at seeing you]

    





Be Strong My Friends

When they curse you 
And they blame you
When they passively
<strong>BOLDLY</strong>
Begrudgingly 
Or in all other ways
Attempt to shame you
Into fleeing as if
You have nothing to be
And no reason to exist 
Or to write such things
As these and this
When they try 
And try
And YOU find yourself
Your world 
Suddenly spinning
Upsidedown
On brand a new axis
It is then 
In that moment
Of parry and precaution 
That you must decide 
How it is best to be
How you currently see
And can share such things
Beneficial to those
Who WILL always stray
When you hoped they'd stay
But as for me and my house 
We will ardently seek
And oftenly pray 
To show kindness to those 
Who cannot 
For the truth of them
Or the life of them
Or for the anger they store inside of them
BEGIN to see
The ways in which 
That the sacrificial lamb
Has blessed us all
With this
A BRAND NEW LIFE
Within EACH DAY
This my friends 
Is why I say
Be strong in this</em>
And we'll walk that</em> way

    





Best Words

It pleases me to think 
That one day I woke up
And with 
Whatever coffee I had
Made
The best poetry I would ever sing
And noone heard a sound from me
Not even then
And yet I was free
Completely and indifferently

    





be tired with me?

like a scratching record
around I cannot break
and in circles find nothing
more than our something should
this unwaking headache
with its cold sweat and migraines
is the only thing left
the only path to take

until we are left therein
that parallel state of unbeingawake

    





Between Ivory Keys

Ripples beneath concrete feet
Falling all around the trees
Are the days of lightful shadows still
Are the scenes unseen to me
Quietly
Softly
Mostly 
Between ivory keys
Are the pulling, plodding, plucking leaves 
Which kiss the earth like a butterfly
And depart fluttering with bus stop wings 
To no other earthly springs comply

    





Between The Mountains

There is a quiet hour
       Between the mountains

When the trees are higher in the crown
       Than any expectation

And life, wildlife, lays bare beneath
       Resting at the feet of man most kind

Be it moved or unshown 
       In this afternoon hour

The quiet distance covers the in-betweens
       And is found there, atop the tops

    





Between The Trees

Your fingers as they brush the bark 
Turn suddenly and bark back at me 
All they wanted to be was here at home
Was to be alone  
And to know the self between the trees

    





Beyond Compare

So beautiful, so very fair. 
On a man made breeze wavers golden silk. 

Extravagant each strand of hair. 
So intent, with soft intense. 
A gentle look to show how quietly she cares.

For or not for me remains to be seen. 
And yet beautifully she looks at the silver screen, 
In such a way which is beyond compare. 

Her eyes of blue as summer streams. 
Her thoughts obscured, 
But her smile maintains a certain air.

Quietly I catch a glimpse of the unseen breeze. 
Ever fading, hard to find, 
And beautiful beyond compare.

    





Beyond How And The Hiding Moon

How does one cross an ocean
Begin a journey in a direction 
Unknown

Let die an echo in an empty room
And speak without hating
Your only sound

How, how

Do you let yourself be seen
For real
When all around you is judgemental and rude

When the moonlight amongst others
Is not willing to avail itself to you
How then will you begin

With a breathing step 
Into the drowning unknown 

Beyond how is the when you will go

    





Beyond The Bones

Iron
Wood 

Oak
And stone 

Ash
Glass 
And wax unwound

How all will melt 
And all will burn 
Long before his heavenly throne
Reveals itself forever more 

Because we are the human
And he is the God 

He reveals himself in ways
Most unknown

His structures are that of pure existence
Carved out of matter we cannot imagine 

He is unlike us
He is everything 
Beyond our frail and fragile bones

    





Beyond The Impending Moon of Doom (Majora's)

I'd forgotten how big the sky was
How full of possiblity was a life filled with flight
Yes, Majora's
When that moon was hanging over me in such a way
It made it impossible to see the night from day
And to separate the time from the potential life
Be it without a countdown or accursed limit
But of a life outside of the dream far away

    





Big IF

If songs had bodies
Yours would be
So fine
And refined
And full of life
Most fine

    





Bird In Water

I am a bird beneath the waves
Though it be dark and blue and deep
My wings are not best suited to the sea

Though lofty heights are known to me
It’s beneath the waves I wish to be

To see the fish and how they breathe
Through coral and the crystalline

Though I am free
With neither cast nor current in-between
I am a bird beneath the waves
I do not belong within the sea

    





Bitter Rain (Falling)

Nine meters per second 
Twenty miles per hour
No speed is sufficient for this
This kind of falling 

To close this wound I never knew
To slow my waking thoughts alive
One moment I am all a hope 
The next I am crashing into a puddle down

But not like the others
Ever falling over and over again
For I am a selective raindrop now

    





Bitter Truthful Bookends - Left

Cried
In realization that
Even memories die alone

    





Bitter Truthful Bookends - Right

Sighed 
In revelation of
How sleeping waking is the same

    





Black And Blue

Robbed from my throat, 
These thoughts of you. 
Pulled apart like spider legs, 
Only the frame remains, 
A body be it black and blue. 

Tired and worn,
Of being reborn. 
Will we be soon?
The dusk and the dawn,
Of each new moon.  

Arise and fall,
Like the trembling falls. 
But beneath these still waters,
Is where our time, 
Will begin anew. 

In the darkest night, 
All the billions of lights, 
Call out to you. 
Like the shimmering stars,
To kiss away the black and blue.

    





Blank Page Lies

The perfection in the blank page
Could never be matched by me
It says
In a boldfaced lie
Designed to keep me from the one thing which will
The TRY

    





Bloom

Dark hole star
Carved without knowing into the corner of my heart
With an appetite for bloom in it's glorious range
For apples, for trees
For meadows, for plains
As it is for the seasons prior desire
It is that which you want
As your taste requires

    





Blue Eyes Looking Down At Brown

The snow light bright lays down beneath, looking up at these blues, with your brown eyes so deep and bright. And time, time is but a memory felt within a dream of oneself. And in believing this found therein our reflective sight.

    





Blue Moon

She tasted like the atmosphere
Deep, dark, and blue as the moon
Distant as the fading star in the northern most hemisphere
And yet each time I tasted her
I was reminded that there was no oxygen to be had in her

    





Bookstores

Humans look at books and see
A thousand opportunities 
Pages to turn and how they could be seen
By the other eyes
Naturally

    





Brass or Gold?

Would you hold my crown every night?
Polish me until I shine?
Endlessly
Until we can see 
The reflective wish in the others mind
Would you polish me all night?

    





Breakfast Haiku

Good scrambled eggs can find
More competency in hand
Than that within mind

    





breath.a

seeing you
in minds eye now
and your winding ways
of browning trees
makes me remember and breathe
in the taste of cold 
which November only knows 
and December wishes it could be
(or was)

    





Breath A Drug To Breathing

There are days when breathing is not a thought. 
And others where breathing is all I wish to be. 
Present. 
Me.

    





Breathe Deeply In Darkness

Does the sunlight worry about its moonlight reflection?
When it cannot see stars either you or me? 
No!
Because even in darkness it just sits back,
And with ice on its arm, 
Breathes.

    





breathing deeply in the tunnels of memory

I'm not angry, I just sense 
and in perpetual thought, be 

I breathe, deeply in these tunnels 
because your memory is more shallow than me

    





Breathing In Cold Circles

My heart knows no hatred 
My loss no existence 
There is only snow, and ash, and rain, and waters flow 
In this directional way no more 
I am contented and lost 
Happily there with what I do and do not know

    





Breathing In The Night Sky

The stars
To me
Are so close
Tonight
That I forget
The distance
Of you

    





Breathing Last

The difference between life and stories
Is that when one ends
The other keeps breathing
Or not

    





Breathing Mist

Like a forest breath
Breathe out with me 
With a gentle hiss

As you cup your hands 
Hear the hallow hall  
And the hushing kiss

Breathe out with me
Into wooded abyss
This breathy mist 

Breathe out with me
Breathe out with me
This breathing Mist

    





Breathing, Swimming, Being

There is more to living 
Than just a breath
Or a heartbeat being

Just as there is more to swimming
Than the ocean
Freshwater streams
And the pools filled with meaning

Simply put

There is always more 
To be 
Than being

    





Breathing Water

Sometimes
All a man can do is
B R E A T H E 

Be with the current 
Atop the stream
And alive within the breeze

Sometimes
All a man can do is
B E

    





Breathing You Out

I’ve let your echo 
Ruminate and round
Bouncing 
For far too long 
And now 
I breathe you out

    





Breathless Day, Clouded Chest

The midnight clouds
You will never see
Because they do not, cannot, exist until
Your small chest breathes
And beauty speaks itself into the unseen sky
While you sleep

    





BRIGHT

Sometimes you just have to sit there silently
Outside or near the tallest windows true
Just to let the light shine inward again
Just to find yourself feeling   
Once there alive in being 
Through and through

    





Bright Behind The Dark

I know I'm missing the sun
       Because all I can see 
     Are the inside of these familiar windows 
  No less alive
But much less bright

    





Bright Eyes

If smiles were salutations then we've conversed a hundred times 
Our paths always crossing briefly never seeking to intertwine 
The mountain air calls out to us both to walk, to run and hide 
And the words that seem to escape us both perplex me every time 
As seasons change and years fly by the truth resonates inside 
That despite our newfound friendship we will never cross the divide 
The gap that separates two hearts but hinders not bright eyes

    





Brightside

My anthem struck me like a chord
When a Willow tree become a whip

As a leaf I'd yet to be truly born
Into the confidence of another tune

It was The Killers first who slew my fear
Who called my snapping hand a whisp

With a firey, crackling, flailing hiss
My anthem, adrenaline, I'm in love with you

    





Broadhead Sun

I swear S O M E T I M E S that
   I'm the only one who see's the sun
   like an arrow dart 
   erratically beyond the target of time
   and A R I S E into the sky of life 

We all who miss (just high)

    





Broken Line of Sight

Hide and seek
With impossibility
As no such tired runs far enough away
To escape the eyes

    





Broken Mold

It's the little things in life
Which can slowly crush the soul
The will to fight, the old desires
Ever changing and growing older 

Be it in the misunderstanding
Or the mistreatment of others
Or the values to which you so preciously hold

I find its better to take the time 
To reshape the clay
Rather than to let yourself be bothered
By the deconstruction of your most beloved mold

    





Building

Inanimate
How much easier it would be, to be
Or so at least I like to think
When my mind runs away from the building of me
Like a brick I fall
Like a block I sink
Hopefully back into place
But if it's not for me
Would you tear me apart God brick by brick? 
And build me as I was meant to be?

    





Building A Realization

First word a dart
Second and third Lego parts
Pieced together until the bridge is built
Until the nothingness is captured in the still
And held there in midair
As you jump the mid embrace of somber quill 
And I 
The hand to hold it still

    





Building, Turning, A Commitment

A home 
That is not something you buy
A home is someone you ask
A turn in the road of life 
You try
Having better than taken alone
You build each other up

    





Building Words

No words will ever say or stay
The chilling storm
The quiet calm
Or the persistent want which cannot be reached 

No
Words can only bridge those gaps
Which wish to be bridged  

Because storms give way to rampant floods
Which wash away the builders hopes
When poorly built

In such instances as these
Words are not always the best way
To build and begin again

    





Burn Away

It's the familiar way those fingers play the same old song I sent you away to. 
Because when I heard it for the first time I knew, that it was both appropriate and true. 
Still to this day, its hard to say, that we stood and swayed a certain way. 
But every time I hear this play, I'm transported back, and taken away. 
To a time when we were surrounded by a firey way. 
To a night so long and full of sorrow, that I was sure we wouldn't see the light of day.
And through the ashe and endless smoke, my wispers knew not what to say. 
Except that I was sorry to go, but we always knew it would end this way. 
How the fire and brimstone was not our dream, but a reality which burned away.

    





Burning Arc Seconds

To be a star is to burn
Until the end of all trajectories 
To be alone but never alone
Adjacent amongst the galaxies invert
Knowing you'll fall 
Less because of being human
But moreso because nothing can inevitably burn
For forever in arc seconds time 
To be a star is to burn

    





Burning By Nature

There is no dark side of a star
Only hydrogen and heat 
Careening forward and beyond
The bitter cold of knowing

Unaware of the reality of fall
Unpersuaded by all
Afraid of nothing that has been
We are not falling stars, my friend

No we are not

    





Burning, Falling Fast, Ignite

Falling stars always appear so far
So bright as they burst with their last dying light 
How crazy is it to think that we, humanity
May see, but will never feel, their burning light 

(4LINE)

    





Burning Reflection

Some days are the sun
Some days are the moon
And some days are the stars which burn out in-between

    





Burning Thoughts

To put your thoughts to paper
And the flame to thought until it flies
Into ashes enbrace
Until it becomes the sky

    





Burn on above and beyond

If there's one thing I know
More than anything un
It's that the sunsets will fall
The skies will stand tall
And just out of reach
Of this shared everyone 
The stars will burn on 
And be unseen when they finally decided to come undone

    





Bursting Words

You coat me
Like a blanketed fall
Turn eyes like stars
And speak bursts like fireworks 
Into a sky of strangers . You alight 

Well lit in memory still

    





By A River, Beneath A Tree

A river flows beside a tree
Which grows upon an earthy hill
Both strength and beauty can be seen
No need to hide
No want for veil 
And the word of God flows underneath 
As the river runs
To foster all which growth entails
So enter in lovers embrace 
And share in the water
Drink it deep
Both when it flows and when it speaks
But especially when it stands still

    





By the time you read this, I will be asleep

This thin and failing, streak of light
   lights up my face 
And shows the yesterday memories
   to the door away
And I, am tired, writes itself
   across my face
   almost handsomely

    





C 6

I just want to sit somewhere. And drink coffee with no-one. Until my thoughts are renewed, and my feet spring alive with a new thread of carbon.

    





Cadence Alive

An aged old man on his back
A newness strong as right in mind
With a single edge to unhinge the darkness past
Outlast the game in another pawn
Anoint the seed in the soil of life
And grow, beyond the treelines unpredicted height
Into the stars with fingertips aloft
To paint the newborn sky each night
Because with age comes, not only the will to pass, but the path
Made clearer still by the same daylight seen
As a bedridden old man in his own death scene
And we are but a glimmer in the ripplibg life of another's sight

    





CaFe

Awful coffee still has its caffeine 
And by that same logic 
Even awful people can still sharpen me 

Unless they're decafe
In which case, 
Ew

    





Cafeism 874

Eventually ...
You drink coffee for what it means
For how you see yourself when you drink
And to think 
... Eventually

    





Caffeinated

My coffee heart turns
And headache burns
Into nothing less 
Than a Monday furnace

    





Caffeine

My shoes are empty, no rhythm or beat to fill the soles. 
My energy tank is drained and dry, 
And my crutch, my sugar, is attempting to consume me whole. 

I push for something, try and try,
But designs escape me everytime. 
As time reveals that I am tired, and tested by my own desire.

I beg for sleep to make me whole,
And yet I must and must persist. 
To fight the battles new and old, and find my way throughout the mist.

I persevere and do persist to pull my art out of nothingness. 
Until the sun on this day sets, 
I will create until I rest.

    





Calaquendi

With eyes to weep beneath the night
Neath trees which ought to've lasted ere
How sad it was for me to leave
Before such fullborn youthful tree
I'd turn myself once more, I could
And cry her name fullborn aloud
To catch my breath, and see her all
Before my Gondolin did fall

    





Call Me By The Name You Know

No fear calls my name
quite like the opportunity of you
does.

And in remembering this, and in the failures that
let the truest of minds remain
alive.

For in the most quiet of conveniences found
there is only the one thing which I truly 
distain.

And that being is of no importance or remembrance worthy, compared to the one who now calls my
name.

    





Can I buy you a cup of coffee or something?

Truth without arrogance 
Flattery without flaunting mind
Seeing your turned back I keep coming back to
Just as those truer lost words you will probably never find 

In such an unburdening lost
Round yourself within another binding tie
And be free of the circling expectative ring
As this just ine memory molded makes my clay heart sing 

And so
I ask you this nothing now 
Can we just skip the second awkward remembrance and
Can I just go ahead and buy you a cup of coffee or something
?

    





Can Opener

Like a can
I desire to open myself up
So that someone may taste 
And partake in the difference
But none can see
No none can see
At least I believe
In the difference in me

    





Capable

Are you scared?
That someone will 
Or will not understand?
The meaning therein?
Because you can ask any of those who really know
For I am such a man

    





Carnival, A Tanka

Carousel clouds, spin

In skies of unnatural,

Colorful being.

Until onenness felt, is

Of carnival earth beneath

    





Cartoon Family

Time is suspended 
Held in place and to be examined
Whenever I’m there
Within with those people 
We are yet somehow still animated

    





Cast Away

It’s like an echo off a cliff
Quiet as the hissing wind 
Which hums over the wingtips of a gull 
Lost in a sea of sand
Beneath the feet of a Castaway 
Are the memories of bygone times and days gone by
They are washed away 
As is every hope and happiness 
Which once was brought upon, by the comforting rain 
Though the trees connect his head and hands
To the barren sky above his head
No firelight can catch a glimpse of the looking glass
Or signal back, beyond the reef and its crooked back
For his is only in his heart inland
That survived the falling flights decent
Out of the sky above his head 
Where the wings of changes could carry him back
Home to her arms, at loving last

    





Casting Is Like Flying

The tensions slips
And in an instant the air whips vibrant
Most churning colors in the July sky
Offset the black outline
Of a spry nymph in flight

Who was I to wake and think that I 
Wouldn't be the one to fly
When I was

    





Casting Out Your Bullet Love

Finding your memory 
Lodged deep like a bullet wound 
And in reaching past ribs, I heal 
And turned out your used-to-be onto the street 
And now only its recollection collects 
And makes me money

    





Castles By The Sea

When all I try
And all I do
Falls down like sand
Midst castle molds

With knees 
Red and worn

And eyes
Read and worn

I will dig the softly sudden earth
And build myself
A castle new

Never to be torn down
In this life

    





Caught Between Fog

Fog like mountain eyebrows, hovering above the area of Earth which splits between the snowy ground.

A train to steep the far side of the valley, and the other now filled with the exiting towns.

And I the traveler between the two heights. Wondering how and why this fog stays this way around.

    





Cause

Why?

Because I like her voice.

Why?

Because it feels like home.

    





Caverns And Ripples

Like a ripple...
Spreads the inner arrogant statements of self
Which you'd never tell someone else
Because even sounding them out sounds loud
But you believe in them still
In the quiet subconsciousness of self
Like the echoings of an inner cavern
There is something there
Because something that once cast shadows fell

    





Caves (The Unconscious)

There is a cave
Within a cliff
Beside a great waterway

And I don't know 
That it exists

How the ocean moves and carves it's way
Without me watching it every day

How the caves of mind turn ever in
In their unexplored and unannounced way

    





Ceasar

I close my eyes above my salad
Nobody here can see
Praying that God would keep her well
And take care of her
Be it well away from me

    





Celestial

Our eyes see stars 
Our earth her neighbors 
Just as near and far are subsequently born
Of human terminology

    





Certain Qualities

Rare metal doesn't substantiate
The substance within 
Just as the height of a skyscraper is not the sky 
But instead
Be just as you say you are
And am

    





Certain Sounds, Revisited

Sleeping soundly on your memory now

I dream of uncollected worlds 
Where young girls dance at summer weddings 
And foolish men take their cars for spins and whirls 

I've seen you less and less, in the headlights of happiness 
My onetime escape 
From you I'm free

Within the dance of newfound reflectiveness, I'm free indeed

    





Change Doesn't Walk Inward

So many wait
For another life
To walk into their own
Just to change the self 

When really they
Are the only person 
Who can pull apart the former fabric 
Who can lend a mending hand to help

    





Change Is The Truest Expectation

Expect no answers
To come from your mind
As it knows no more 
Than tempered clouds
And expects too much, of you always 

Expect no truth
To flow from your heart
When it's heavy with rain
And pouring out
Of this saturation found, and moreso

Expect instead
To be and fade
Like the ends of the endless
So comes the new 
The next in line, is now

Just as the day most true is in ending 
Found

    





Charcoal Writings, A Tanka

Dark stars scratch lightly
On uneven canvas sky
And I in seeing
These new lines now come alive
Love her galaxy even

    





cheating on my consciousness

There are days on one knee when
I fall for myself
And others then where I
divorce into the dark deep
nonexistence of sleep 

The future can have the kids

    





Cherished Voice

Your song is like a clover field
Lucky 
Peaceful
Always at ease
Rolling like the streamless hills 
Your body right here next to me 

Within the grass 
And on the wind
Ever is your voice to be
And even when I’m not in sight
To see your jawline ever slight 
As you sing a clover field to sleep

I know your voice 
As I know your eyes 
And the way much like your song implies
That you are peaceful and at ease 
Like a field of clover
You’re lucky to me

    





Chest Haiku

Peaks and valleys found
On every fragile mountain
Past and present young

    





Child Of The Rain

Blessings upon you child of the rain
Who walks so freely beneath the clouds

How your life is filled with a freedom of heart
And a clarity of mind, which is unrivaled by
Even the most ill motivated and questioning eyes

Blessed are you

Because you understand the collective side
And the joy which can be found inside
When all around you is pouring down
And falling out

When so many others are hurrying up and scurrying about
Just to curse the sound 
Of the falling rain

It is you alone who are not afraid
Of stepping out, and soaking yourself 
Be it skin and bone, one and the same

How you welcome the storm without concern
And dance and sing without reserve
Amidst the downpour of the rain

Like a child who was never taught 
Or even told to try and abstain
From such innocent things

For you are alive and always well
Within this, the present moment 
Most endlessly and without restraint 

How you throw your arms around the sky
Most lovingly each time it cries
To comfort it

To hug the storm without remorse
And to appreciate the summer’s day
For what it is, devoid of heat

Oh childlike, child of the rain

It’s because of you and your carefree ways
That I wish the storm could ever stay

And perhaps one day 
That we two could play
Right here alongside, within the rain

    





Chilled Coffee In Warm Hands

Snow knows no depth
Nor showers embrace 
Like the sea at peace
Or the rivers mid run 

For the coldest thing 
Ever moreso than
These distant relatives embrace 
Is this coffee in hand 

It is happily so 

[chilled to perfection]

    





Chill With Me, Amongst All This Chaos

Regardless of those outcomes 
These comings and goings of great joy and unpleasantry   
Sing as my heartstrum stings
Bow and my base drum rows 
For regardless of today aloud 
Would you just be with me
My world for-unever in being</em>
Together we'll forget the how

    





Chocolate

Be like chocolate
Not because of the sweetness 
Or because of the health implications, no

Be it milky white or dark devoid of light
Be rich like chocolate 
How it's void of all time

Because chocolate is always so well received
Often described as full
In the remnants of another person's mind

And to those who are alergic to it
We say how sorry we are for that
Because it tastes so flavorful richly fine

    





Choice and Joy

I cannot, in good faith
Recommend anything which 
Will make you happy immediately 
And yet miserable indefinitely

    





Chosen Home

When I'm here;
      My soul does not stir.
It settles behind closed eyes
      And breathes a contented breath...
A summer sigh.

Knowing that the winter will return,
     Like an old friend.
Along with the whistling radiators...
     To hold to cold in utter contempt, 
And to warm my frostbitten fingers.

    





Christmas Reminiscence

He puts on his headphones and walks through the house. 
Weaving between the family members, and the memories, darting in and out. 
With only the Beatles, and an empty cup, to console himself. 
He is happy to be set apart on Christmas Day, standing right beside the remnants of his former self.

    





Clairvoyance

They don't believe me when I say, 
My foresight stretches a long way. 
Down the winding road of time, 
Into the valley of decline, 
I see my age, in the faces of those who have traveled this way. 

I see my future in their shoes, 
I see the certain way their memories fade like the morning dew. 
And yet I have arrive at the early hour, 
Before the dew has time to flee. 
Before the earth has time to turn, 
The dawn itself calls out to me.

For it's here I see what it simply means to simply be, 
A present in the presence of the bitter sweet. 
The better notion of pursuing passions which never seemed to be, 
A suitable means of living without ease.

And yet such fear of fear itself is what I need,
To motivates a man such as me. 
To presuppose and catch a glimpse beyond the horizon, 
Into the distance where I decree, 
That the next life will be a more suitable life for me.

    





Clarion Sound

When the cloud drums sound 
Piercing silence aloud 
Booming minstrel singing in the collective song of time
Once again then I
Not in Eru Ilúvatar
But in the clarion voice of Christ 
Be found 

We are all one in song alike
We are all one

    





Classic Beauty

You are the twist at the corner of your cheek
Like a youthful expression from the past
Meeting at an intimate place, which I’ve yet to know 
But hope—beyond all hope—that I could meet

    





Clearings

As the trees edge the clearing, so do I reach you. 

As the sound of the breeze unseen is heard, so also has been the truth of me.

Some days afire, some days rain.

And some days to lose completely in thought, and others like the clearing standing still and in frame.

    





Cleverness

Some days I just don't have the words
So I ask him to provide for me
All the pros for my failing verse
And unfailingly he does this for me
Because he always simply is
As I will never ever be
Half as clever as my God can be

    





Cliff Diving

The point of realization is a scary cliff to overlook
Higher than you've ever felt and lower than the lowest of lows
There is no telling which way you should venture
 Or in which direction you should go
Because the fear is what makes the venture an adventure 
And only at the bottom of the jump will you know 
That the fear which you were feeling 
Was only fear of the unknown

    





Cliffs

This is me letting go...falling slowly from the cliff of selfish desire, into the cool and clearness of the conscience below.

Of you and my desire for you...this is me letting go.

    





Closet Doors

Put my ghost to bed already.
It's half past two
and we 
are neither of us, young.

    





CLOUDBURSTS (7's)

WELLING UP inside your eyes
A sky is born above you
And ANEW your stars cry out

    





Clouded Fly

The clouds racing across the sky
Remind me that my chance to live
My window into this varied life 
Is rather short-lived
And that one day, as I certainly know
I'll be able to fly across the sky 
Beside the clouds 
But never high enough to look down
At least with this particular set of eyes

    





Clouds And Thunder Are Very Different

Someday their skies will open up
And they'll realize that 
I was always a cloud 
Just never aloud
As clouds do

    





Clouds Pass By

No sky will ever hold such elegant phrases
Or pen to carve the cursive clouds
No such dreams were just a thought to be
Not meant for you indefinitely
No, like clouded skies they were ever passing through
Just as now no memory will remain
Either of or through or of you

    





Cloud Spirit

I fell from the sky
Ages ago
And that is why I like the rain
Because it reminds
And disguises that I, am not home again
Because when it rains 
I can smell the clouds
I can even pretend 
That I’m living in the sky again

    





Cloudy Eyes

Isn't that the idea of the ideal? To conflate small with big? To expect every sighted cloud to be, exactly as you see it is? Be it building towards or not in part. The clouds are no more a part of you, than you are a part of whatever dream you see.

    





Cloudy with the chance of a haiku

Clouds know not how soft
We think they are and praise their
Being a vapor

    





Coaxing joy out of the monday earth

Maybe today
My words will change
The face of the earth 
And make her smile 
Smile again

    





Coffee, Chaos, Smiling, Haiku

My bliss palpable 
Is the chaos of their shared
Collective coffee

    





Coffee Heart

Blessed
With a warmth of be being
And a sound of beating 
Inside this coffee chest
A heart is (sound)  

Unrest 
Is not a string to be pulled
In this piano choir 
Or in this soundless town
Where the wandering soul walks (aimlessly round)

Restful
Is not a feeling felt 
Or minded state 
So much as it is a conscious place 
(within cup)

    





Coffee Life

Most complete I feel
     As half a cup
          When my sip in process is

Though when empty still
     I am sorrowful not
          It's a drink unending with

    





Coffee Moon

There is a dark side
To the brightest coffee moon
In the cup before me now
Which stands alone

Sinking, smiling 
Into a napkin brown as dust
Pale as where the snow begins

    





Coffee Shop Memories Continual

The same old tables know my name

And memories felt

In feelings like young hands first touch

Return in eyes one and the same

In creation, I create

And in hopeful optimism grow

Looking continually cut

Like the flowers by the highway lives 

In wishing and where is why I tend to find

That you are the foremost thought of late

The only sonnet ever on my mind 

In a humming truth like a vibrant bird

You are here most every time alive

    





Coffee Shop Sitting

When you see me sitting there
     Contemplating
          Forgetting life

It’s partially to be seen
     But also to be 
          More than away from the self-trapped in skin

As I AM 
     But I’m NOT
          In that moment again

    





Coffee With Cream

When it stirs its like a volcano
When like a geyser it does hiss
Like an atomic bomb 
It tears apart the molecules of bitterness within my cup
That's where the replacements happen and meet 
Dulcet and stirringly sweet
The mushroom cloud encased in liquid
Pours forth steam and radiates 
The internal heat 
Of coffee

    





Cold Armor

Some days the lance hits home
And your chest is punched through your armor
Vibrating your heart until it's up against the cold
Yes
Sometimes when you've offered yourself to be struck
You are just that
Mere fragments of yourself within a suit of armor cold

    





Cold Brew

Let the wind and rain on this dreary day refresh your mind, and seep into this, the very corners of your soul. That way we can drink in the storm together. Instead of our midweek coffee, hot, we'll brew this Friday morning cold, and sip until the weekend appears. Polite and unfolding, as the packet of paper and its peers, for the cream is sweet enough for the cold brew itself. And so I ask of you. Would you drink in a metaphor or two with me, just for a break? In order to take away, from the truth of day which has yet to grow but an hour old. Let the wind and rain suppress all thought, as we sit beside, in the room of old. Breaking, waiting for the will-less voice which always seems to sleer and say...get back to work you sleepy, seeping, sipping souls. Take your supposed spice coffee calling called cold brew and go.

    





Cold Building

The fondness of this soul building feels like hot chocolate to me. Warming this old unwilling heart to create and be. For another day. Another day.

    





Cold Car

My heart is like a snow laden car
Freezing in the bitter cold

Left to stand in a parking lot semi-alone

Clearing my windows I depart
Most anxiously to feel the need

And yet as in each morning, each winter
When the days are dreary and quick to dark

There is a frost to be found all around

And so my hesitant in heart
Is to turn over and start

Warming only by this, the end of this drive

For my heart is like a snow laden car
Covered and only to be seen in part 

When cleared away the beating heart
Is too warm too late and frozen still

    





Cold Cream

Cold cream,
sweeping taste,
atop the hottest cocoa.
Pure bliss which
incites violent smiles
below my eyes.

    





Cold Fingers

I feel the cold inside my fingers
Trying to turn them into Steel
Like notches on an arrowhead
My joints will not yield
To the bending ways of the steering wheel

Metal and plastic, ice and ore
Barrel beneath my soaking shoes
And I the driver of this Ford
Try desperately to warm
Be it not to you

    





Cold Footsteps Approach

The grass, fearing lots,
Packed up and headed southwest 
Having snowy thoughts

    





Cold Moon Over Atlantic

Cold as moonless sun
Close as stars 
Far off as city streets
Swept apart by the combing of the beach 

Mere steps away
From the sandy sea
Is the salty churning stairwell down 
Into the depths

But there no answers are to be found
Just like here
Only sounds
Are the words to me

    





Cold Mornings

Cold candy
Pop rocks bursting in the morning hail 

My mouth a mess and mind untested
Tired and still

The morning reaches out to me 
But nothing gets better at this time of day

I wish my words could carry me
Like I carry a them, away

    





Cold Nights Reflection

As the sky looks back to return my surprise 
With almost longing and lingering eyes 
I am enchanted now by what I see
Just beyond the clouds within the sky  
Not a nebula of precarious height
But a collective unit (almost) organized 
How they absolutely are and alive
How the creator created them all to burn
In such a particular direction and light 
Would you repaint the picture that is my life?
To better reflect the collectedness 
And the calmness found in this cold night

    





Cold With Cold

A slight draw
With jawbones peaked

Another day revealed 

Revealed to be cold
And cold with cold
On this mountaintop

Yet no wind remains 
To appeal to me

I will not yield

    





College

This place is not my home
It's just the first place that I chose
A quiet corner of the world
A noisy hall of brick and stone 

My quiet comfort is in you
A window seat, a quiet room
A place to eat beside a fire 
The distant sound of passing shoes

You are both safe and insecure 
Much like the students here before
I am a mark upon your wall
I am a figure behind your door

Within assignments I am tied
Within this desk I find my mind
And though my memories will fade
I hope these words surpass the time 

-SS

    





Colm

One with the earth
Some days so much
That I cannot help but smile
At our collective being

And then other days away
I would rather be
As I'm not one of you
I see

    





Colorationz

No one knows the color of the sky
Our rods and cones decree it is 
An abundant place 
With waves of clouded wishes warm
And cold hard truths 
When it rains and often storms 

And yet know one knows the ways in which its true colors go
And show
And show

    





Colorful Haiku

No coloring known
Is such as described by man
Ever seen alive

    





Come Rain Or You

Rain has not the weight of snow
In freeing me from this human coil
It whispers quick
Its children come and go
And I am left with puddles everywhere
To fade in suncast alone 
Heavy on the longing
Light on the being true
When all I want is a day to do nothing at all
That or another glance of you

    





Comfortable Stagnation

Comfort is a funny thing
All graciousness and charm at first
Like cotton down or endless cups 
Or a pool of cool atop the earth

But in too much comfort and you will drown
In the constant reassurance of self worth

Too much of that comfort will actually keep you 
From the discovery of new to be found
At work

And by work I mean 
THE SEARCH

    





Commit Our Memory To Memory

How often do the clouds get looked at
For who they are
As compared to what you think you see? 
In them and these?
If you would be so kind
As to opt into please
Would you commit this
Our memory 
To memory 
What do 
You see
?

    





Commotionn

How can I hear
Past the noise of all beings
?
If my own being cannot be
In quiet breathing
?
I can't 
.

    





COMPETITOR (a haiku)

Your will is nothing
When I'm yet young and living 
My own will-be done

    





compounding presence

pressure is a coin to pass
between train and screaming tracks beneath
with the force of fiction and heat pressed between
so it is in my soul when you are near and unknowingly dear 
to me - passing by in fast

    





Concerning God

God is good. 
He uses all things for good. 
I trust in him when things are good. 
And I will trust in him when things are not so good. 
It's a good thing to know that he is good. 
Or else I would be good and stuck. 
A good-for-nothing vagabond or a good for little son in law. 
Yet I am good because God is good. 
And though I'm not always so good he's so good to me. 
It feels soooo good that God is good. 
Makes me feel good so many times. 
It's so true, that God is good all the time and all the time God is good.
So good for you and good for me. 
Even good for God in his complexities. 
He is far too good and gracious to be. 
And he's far too good for the likes of me.

    





Concerning Memory

Like a beautiful window in a summer home that's now closed to you. And the only memory that remains is the last day before before this new autumn view. Unseen is the growing day of this memory between me and you.

    





Concerning Self

I thought about me, long before I became me. And though I am here, I believe, this is where I was meant to be.

    





Concerning Selfishness

Bigger things than self speak out
Constantly seeking an ear to hear
But are drowned out most by the selfish self

Heaven forbid we hear what we fear

    





Concrete and Clay

You are not bound by your genetics, only inclined by them. You can change, your degrees, to a degree. 

I find.

We are all inclined

    





Concrete Heartbeat

Jazz is like a city pace

A concrete heart
A padded foot
A streetcart selling food to keep

A city never devoid of place

Loves most it's people
It architectural grace
And its future bolted to the grass

A city never leaves or depart

A concrete quiet heart always lasts

    





confuscated?

she would look at me like I had stars in my eyes
though I know not why, what I love is what I know
you see I love rustic hills, forgotten and still
i love breathing nothingness in, out the quiet, and the ease
i love freshly cut grass and forest meadows never meant to be tamed
i love the snapping fish most talkative and the slim bodies of waters beneath grasping trees
i love he quiet sky above the 3 a.m. streets
and the flickering candlelight whispering things
and above all of these things I hope not to love, is me
though that choice is a which I do heartily admire
and give it still my most willingness forward 
if you'll see and let me also see
please do

    





Consistently Away

I know you're running
Never still
Because I can see your feet
From this distance beneath 
I know you're running 
Even still

    





Consisting Of

I Am Comprised
Not of stars
Or of seas 
Or of trees
But of leaves
Because I fade
And will Fall 
To these 
Winter winds

    





Constant Daily Hopefulness

The hope comes around
Like the twilight gleaming 
And flickers in eyes unbeknownst to each other’s being

    





Constant Noise of Self

Beautiful silence
Beautiful sound 
Stop thinking you can be saved by this
Another noise in the city
Another quiet little town

You can't be saved by your own hand

That's why he reaches out

    





Continuation

When you find it
Put your finger on it
And press it down on the table before you
All you want is it, over and over again
For that present moment of non-suffering
To continue on
And to never end

    





Contrast

The shadows and consistencies
        The same old songs are killing me

Today I need unfiltered light 
        A life away from reflective screens 

Today I need another me 
        Today I need another me

    





Contrast Of Seasons

I love the warmth of heart as a home run is hit in the July heat. 
The simmer on the weathering skin by the Carolina beach. 
The grilling asphalt beneath the feet of the inquisitive kid.

But above all of this, both prestated and said. 

I love the old worn wintery ways, the weathery, the cold and gray. 
Where the days are as short as the ticks of a clock. 
And the words turn slower somehow in due time. 
Like the mirror's edge, I end and yet, know that I age a little less in the wintertime.

    





Conversingasadrug

The most addictive substance 
Known to man
Is no man at all 
Nor a compound unleashed

But a woman found
And with whom quietly you can
Atop corner seats and within window cafes
Speak 

As if no air had ever passed between

    





Conversing As, A Tanka (S7)

Short the conscious span
Clicks mere seconds on a clock
Which ticks and talks more
Quietly than by we know
No conversation lasts long

    





Cookin

Shouting into the void is not vanity, but humanity
Whereas shouting into a crowd is just insanity

    





Cool Jazz

For old times sake
Old minds sake
Rewind and scratch the sidewalk
With a wingtip gliding by fake 
With old kitten lips pressed to the reed
And the quiet patter of kickdrum feet
Would you play it one more time for me?
With the chattering of Ivory teeth nearby
Would you let the Cool Jazz river run deep?

    





Copper And Tin

Perhaps I am mistaken
Perhaps you are not as you seem in the light of day 
Glimmering like the Pyrite on the infinite cliff
On the edges of which you keep me, ever at bay 
Because after all of the crystal
And shale has been stripped away 
And the quartz, the granite, the limestone pale
Have fallen to the earth beneath 
To be crushed underneath the walking waves
Perhaps then I will see you shine on a barren day 
And my eyes will be better for the sight 
Even if your worth is not in gold
But as I fear it might be, in clay

    





Correlative, Most Unobjectionable

Reaching into absolute nothingness
And yet, with just a glimpse,
or a second, or a moment past
My objective correlative 
Just as you pass
I can grasp at straws and universes unknown
Yet to be explored
By spaceships or writers or wanderers alike

    





Courageous

Have courage 
In darkness
Only death
Can take away
Your every sense

    





Crafting

All that I want, and think that would be best to be, right now, is out in front of me. Presented here within these words, which I crafted deep from within. And to say that I in some way, am too much for you right now. That is cowardice towards what ere could be. So don't claim to know what a word really means, when you want to craft alongside a wordsmith like me.

    





Crash, Built, Fall, Rise

Crash
Like hopes
Midst falling waves
Encircling the outer banks

Built
Like timberus structures
Known only to man
Which pass

Fall 
Like Autumn
On a chorus of empty ears
In distant monologues

Rise 
Like metaphors
In a cautious Spring
Learning to last

    





Crashing

When the waves come crashing over you...and the saltwater fills your mouth.

When you've turned like a towel in the washer of life...and your thought is nowhere to be found.

When it seems almost hopeless to surface again. As your fall was predestined from birth.

In these moments find self in the memory of WHY...as each wave knows its place on the earth.

    





Crashing as we are

There is no sun                          
In the morning of us                
When you're not there beside
  And the night breaks slowly  
On the rocks of dawn              
Crashing as we are

    





Crashing-Over

I can be a wave crashing upon your shore
But when the coastline shakes
And aches its back both towards and in, with force
That shakes me, moves my world

    





Craters And Mountains

Handle your words with caution
Your impressions with care
Because words can impress 
And compress the impressionable 
Like metors on the surface of self 
You may never know 
The value, the worth
Or the cost of such words
On another persons earth

    





Crazy, Constant, Faith

When you see the heights
of the mountain 
and climb
You realize
That it take a certain kind of psychosis 
to believe 
So constantly and with edge
That you can and will
fly

    





Crazy Weather

It is September
And this mountiantop mind
Cannot make itself up
Or make itself out of the true sight
That this warming snow exists

    





Create The Passion

We are not entitled to exciting things. 

Neither sunrise, nor sunset waits for any human hand. 
It simply is, and you must be there to capture it, if you want, and you can.

Lest you complain, that you have been given a lesser chance than another man. 

To live your life without the sleep you need, and sacrifice your hands and feet.
In pursuit of something far short of eternity. 
I call that a distraction. 

On your game again, you cannot help but play again. 
Obsession mixed with practice, is but a single means of expressing passion. 
Which may or may not be, for you, a form of extraction. 

Pulling yourself from the reality of a dissatisfactory life. 
Softening the blow to take, and heading down the wrong direction.
Time and time again, for goodness sake….

This life, this journey, will always be full of such mistakes. 

But to let your doubts drive you away,
To let your fear of the unknown, leech the very passion of your life away,
By means of distraction. 

That my friends, is a failure of action. 
A surrender to the reaction of taking a check, and spending your small fraction.  
When every day, you’d grow in spirit, if you'd only renegade with your your passion. 

Staggering home after half a day, while trying simply to escape, the prior day's’ inability and inaction. 

But I digress. Remember this. 

We are not entitled to live exciting lives of interaction. 

We must first create and encourage, not inhibit, 
The excitement within others, 
Which motivates them towards their own action.

This my friends, is the very nature of passion.

    





Creating for, a tanka

Give me amber warm
And woodgrain soft as sandstone
To meet with pressure
Over time and many miles
My hands will lead you homeward

    





Creative Tanka

Be not mistaken 
I'm here as a creator 
Your words hold no sway
Over my designer's eyes
So keep them in your own lines

    





Creative Wish

You make me smile like a smart chess move 
With anticipation no less intriguing
You are the stroke of ivory in the lingering key of whatever tune has been most on my mind

Your heart must be yellow as a sunflower warm
As it melts away and slowly warms 
The winter of my mind turned cold

And now, amidst the houring fields 
Where this sound once was young
How it is only my wish for the time to grow old

    





Crowned With White

I see myself
Years down the road
My hair thin
Just as my fathers is now
Just as my grandfathers was back then

I see it clearly 
White as snow 
How the realization falls on me
That only in that time will I know
The meaning of true tiredness 
The weariness of aging eyes 
Which have seen the full duration of life

And looking out 
From here inside 
I realize that within my skin
A younger man will always reside 

Even if my glasses one-day need frames
Or my love passes away before my eyes
Or something along those lines

I will probably write forever and always 
Throughout every hour 
Of the day and night 
Because once the mind is awake and alive 
It cannot stop perusing what is right 

 How I see it clearly
In this moment know 
That the white which rests atop my head
Will not forever be of snow

    





Crystal Spray

You are sunlight alive for an instant 
A clear reflection found
In the crystal spray off the gulf of Mexico 

Your eyes cutting waves deep
Like rudder and hull

Your hair in the breeze 
Like the rigging and sails alive

And you all a smile on starboard edge
Perched atop this blue world
You live and atop the cresting waves, fly

She was a sailor

    





Cup Of Tea

The waitress asks what will it be
And I respond with quite ease
No dish or side this time for me
But a cup of tea if you would please 

Though graciously she does agree
That half past two is time for tea
She soon returns with what I need
A cup of tea if you would please 

A purple *** she sets by me
With spoon to stir the boiling tea
I calmly raise my cup to thee 
To a cup of tea if you would please 

As wisps of steam drift up with ease
The rolling in my tum decrees 
This chai delight empowers me
A cup of tea if you would please 

No sugar will I ever need 
To taste the apple and the seed
The spice of life which sets me free
Just a cup of tea if you would please 

Now comes my check it's time to leave 
And the bottom of my cup I see
One final sip to go with me
A cup of tea if you would please 

-SS

    





Current Mood

It's the aching sting 
At the back of my neck
Near the base of my mind
The opposite
Of all those days
Spent warm 
And strong
In the summer sun
Alive, in step
I sat cold with my coat 
Awash in January mist
And sore as this
May be far away
Though it's hard to look past
This thrive-less time
Back to Summers warmth
Sublime
Return to me, please
Most kind
Return to me

    





Currents

It’s NOT that life is NOT worth living, without big ideals
It’s JUST that some are JUST unawares
 
Of the difference between the oceans and the seas
Yet they swim still 

In the channel of being
Creating endless, watery, memories

    





Curvature

Curvature
Bending like the Willow frame
Waving at me 
Like the friendly greeting of a winding lane
All the while knowing
That it's not even your sound which calls to me
No
It's just the winds of life 
Whistling through the outstretched trees
Grasping at experiences which have yet to come
But in time will be
With all of the sounds and windings of a meadow stream
Your curvature and me

    





Curveball, A Tanka

Orbital sending
Flying peregrines sailing
On the winds of wish
And beneath the clouds of hope
Your laces catch the air fine

    





Cut My Hair

Sit 
Remove all cares
---------------------
Cut free the ties 
Of prior strings 
The jagged becoming of nothing 
Which you were
---------------------
Becoming more
Of everything
Of all that is right 
And just of being
Straight and narrow
Clean and keen
In this nothing chair 
---------------------
Sit
Breathe again 
The breath of escape
And cut my hair

    





cutting cards until loss rewinds

war
once declared
turns out a deck to find
cut a pack fiercely into
and with the next flip missed 
then another, and another, all aligned
discover that there are no more ladies left
to be found in such empty hands as these, no
here - there be only jokers left alive

    





Daffodils In A Meadow

Dress a word up like a flower
Still it stems from me
      Water it till the world devours 
      Every petal for a bath 
      And float in it
      Like the daffodil sea
Eternal is the sun by day
How it seeps and soaks the skin
But flowers cannot burn at sea 
They can only ripple in
       Be it tide-ward manner ever present
       With omnipresent tense 
For as roots draw water from the deep
So will salt bring waters end

    





Daily Constant Change (Burning)

I want to burn every day
Like the sunlight in August until the end 
When the October sky says no more to time 
And the earth stands still as I know it in holding will 

Until that day arrives 
I want this burning in my life

    





Dance Again

Remember when a woman’s walk
Her poise and chance
And most importantly, her ability to dance
Is what drew her outline and intrigued
Every able bodied man 
Single or not
To look at her 
To wish to offer her a hand
And yet as I am
An able bodied modern man
I hate who I am
Not because I can, but because I cannot dance
Half so well as I like to think I can
But perhaps…
Under the right circumstances
If I could see the shooting star before it descends
And ultimately lands 
I would possibly 
Almost definitely 
Try and practice dancing again

    





Dancing On The Clouds With You

My heart sounds out 
   And whispers  
Like wind chimes in the air 
   For you

With gentle rest 
   Our dancing steps 
And hopes more light 
   I wish you into this summer memory fair 

Playing carousel dreams 
   Of you
Just to hear

    





Darcy Vantage

A high opinion of ones self
Once held
Is of no concern 
So long as truth is present
So long as justice is found
As it is better to hold understanding 
Than to drop all standards
Due to the frivolities of others
In pursuit of the socially sound
State of being
Which so many profess to be profound
It is not
As I am

    





Dark Hair Sea

Dark as wood grain ocean stain
With ripples I have not
In mind
My fingers
Swim happily crash within waves
Until I am forgot

    





Darling, You Can Always Run To Me

Running can be a listening stream
In the Springtime a bubbling eternity  
Just as crashing can be an Autumn dream 
Falling like a Winter spell over me

(4LINE)

    





Dating Time

I send not love, nor hate 
But acceptance 
Because I cannot help but live with you 
And escape your resting presence 
With what? 
The occasional rest
And sleeping in 
As is the provision of heaven itself in self
I sleep, and thus 
Break from our mortal relationship

    





Daughter Nature

For someone who looks so fervently
A sonnet in the sky
You penned for me 
Daughter nature 
And trust me
Your mother has nothing on you
In this moment you have all of my eyes

    





Daydreamigation (Above The Clouds)

I forgot how fumes worked 
   Being enraptured to be
      Like the endless voice 
         Above the clouded though 
      How intoxicating you were
   In a dream that was solely mine 
To me

    





Daydreaming And Hand Holding

When your hand reaches, grasping mine
It's like I'm pulled through the ice on the pond my own imagination

With fingers waking
I fall from the clouds without landing
And return to the wandering desertless streams

Until you squeeze again
I forget who I am

    





Dear Addict

The only thing you know of me
Is what is not 
And therefore nothing

I am not you
And you don't even know yourself

Sad

    





dear alan watts

You are
Like cloud 
And water 
In the breeze

Like stray fodder
You lift 
And float
And love
And hover above
The blocking sun
At ease 

Until rain
Or snowfall
Or dew 
Does fall 

You are 
As nothing
And yet something
As all

    





Dear Alan Watts

A dither of doubt
Doesn't do justice to this

To the self inflicted wound of how

Carved out like wood
And collapsed like stone

The engraving is known
And read often aloud
To a mind bent on listening
To such wavering doubts

    





Dear Earth, You Suck. Love, The Moon.

Stars burn far as sands
From head to foot underneath
And the moon looks down
In earnest reverie at
The wonder of why we ****

    





Dear God

Reteach me the lesson 
Not greatest of all
But most pertinent to me
Which dissolves all resentment
Teach me that of contentment

    





Dear Insufferable Person - You Suck

Sometimes it’s alright to let nice people be nice
To leave your preconceived notions by the side of the road
To let your pride slowly die
In a shallow grave alone
 
Sometimes it’s alright
To not voice your most negative feeling heard
Or to be so insufferable
And upset at the world
  
Just as in time you may find
That unassuming and kind
Is even easier still 
When you do not your worst
 
Have you tried?
Are you aware? 
Or have you already made up your mind?
To be this same old insufferable version of worst

    





Dear Intuitive

Inbound thought.
Outbound prayer.
Are you well?
Are you versed?

    





Dear May

Dear May
Check your memos
Your voicemail and fax
Because it feels like April today
And it's a full twelve days 
Since your sister has supposedly
"Gone away"

    





Dear Moon, Love Atlantic

With keenest shine and subtle glance
Such chaos between depth and height
His sheen a reflective mirrors pass
Her shadows crashing with shallow bite
Like light splashed sparingly on a neck
Or an elegant hand outstretched in white
Within watery muse she finds each night
A bit of herself reflected in his Atlantic eyes

    





Dear Rainstorm

Dear rainstorm you are most comfortably mine
Like the only thing I truly own in this world
You fall without effort and land with ease
You represent the way of falling in which I should be
Direct, inline, yet flexible 
Fearless and fast whilst in between the earth and sky
Like a middle ground which quickly descends into inevitability
So my life is as short as a rainstorm in the summertime
But I will crack my thunder and lightning each night 
To illumliminate the sky for a time
Just for a moment on this earth
I'll shine most bright

    





Dear Romantics

When you ask or beg saying "please never leave"

Let it not be out of fear or weakness 

But out of a desire to have no such other eternity

    





Dear Rosie

The coolness of night
Which purses my eyes
From far till the dawn of day
And when I stumble at night
It remakes me anew 
And I breathe with both the dew and the old 
Yes, I breathe with both the dew and the old

    





Dear Son

The power of the mind is not eternal
It is not fixed, but it is fickle and it will unwind in due time

But for the betterment of others
For the expression of the self 
And for all things good, most honest, pure and kind

For these things my son develop the power of your mind
That way your body, heart and head may align

    





Dear Time

You’re right about that
There's no turning back
Once you’ve taken your eyes off this good track

Yet in light of that
How I love to drive
And to think aloud until my quiet thoughts talk back

About the process of understand things
Like how my mind survives
And my soul will ultimately outlast

Which is why in life, my fleeting friend
You should always keep your eyes on track
So that one day you’ll smile when you look back

    





Death As A Song

Don’t frown
When death is all around my friends
Smile instead
Because all who are going have already gone
And all which held meaning
Was not necessarily meant for long
So smile in time spent within the song
Because you are part of the Ilúvatar
The grandest crescendo of creative sound
To which any one of us beings could've ever belonged or been found
Now harmonize by the light within
For you are the essence of those once gone
Stand still and sing your hearts first song

    





death is all over yesterday

There are no good old days (plural). 
There is only the day you are having now (singular). 
And death is all over yesterday.

    





death is mortal

We aren’t living and dying
   (in this world) 
      The living and dying are     of   this world

    





Death Of A Good Day

I'm SAD today
But don't ask WHY
It's about my PAST
Best let it DIE

    





Debt

Debt is a weight upon my chest, 
Which pulls me back into the depths of consciousness. 
Like an undertow of unwanted stress. 
Be it car, or loan, or home, it's debt, 
Which remind me of what I've done best, 
Which is guess that the money I've chose to invest, 
Is the money which put my name top of the test. 
In a classroom I sit and assess my progress with the rest, 
Who all just like myself put their names top the test. 
In my car which I drive I feel like I’ve progressed, 
When in truth plastic cards might just leave me a mess. 
In a house with my wife one day I will recess,  
Even when the bank owns my own years to invest.
What is best, who decides how much our children invest? 
In their future, their savings, their sheer happiness? 
Is it just them or us? 
Have we taken such tests? 
What is best? 
An experience? 
Because those we possess. 
Heck I have them myself when I'm home and half dressed. 
In the kitchen at midnight, that's where I invest best. 
But I digress. 
Flip the desk. 
Now I'm the one giving the test. 
I'm a grown man, a graduate, what will I tell the rest, 
Of the youth of tomorrow who are looking for zest? 
What is best? 
Don't ask me. 
I was never one for tests.
Although yes I have used, this instrument known as debt. 
The results can be devastating, if you don’t know what’s best.

    





December Words

Boundless
Limitless 
Endless 
Deeper than skies 
Taller than oceans 
Wider than mountain ranges high
Are these words to me
And to you also
Free
As ever eyes can be between pages
Your Frost to you
My E to E

    





Dehydrated Me

Words can only start
To quench such a rampant thirst
For these thoughts of yours

    





Demelza

Mistress of the cliffs
With eyes like lighting
And the rolling thunderous waves crashing down
Just beneath her fingertips

She is Demelza</em>
The Goddess of solidarity and steadfastness

The epitome of emphasis
And the truth behind every last belmaidens wish 

Which is of course… 
To return to the fields of idleness
Of former youth 

To thresh the wheat and kick the chaff
And to walk the surface of the earth 
With a joy forgetting the hardships
And the toils of the fast 
 
And so each day
She trudges her way 
Though the dark and dull abyss
Until she reaches her new task
And sets herself to another height 
For she was born to be mistress of the cliffs

    





Denial

To deny the curving turn of the earth
Is to deny your own subconscious depth
Your reasoning, wave and subtle worth

    





Denial of Both

You catch in my throat 
Like a prayer which hurts the most
And a song remembered from the very first note

All of nothing and of something and of wishes and of woes

You see right though 
And yet without want for his perfect timing
I find 
That we both in unison say no

    





Departing Train

His eyes implied, as he placed his hand on the windowsill, same as mine.
Just resting on the other side of a sheet of glass. 
Much stood between the two of us. 
Though back in time there was no distance which could separate our minds.
Once torn away, how did my pain reflect the same, inside and out?
How did our moment slip away like the quiet night? 
My attempts in vain to remove the stain of the sacred heart.
His departing train which waivers in the snows embrace. 
And bears my hopes for us away, into the dawn. Into the garish light of day. 
I wait for him in the station stained with falling snow. 
Until the time has stripped away the bitter cold. 
And only memory remains, to find my hand and gently hold.

    





Departure

For she must have a more patient heart than me
To tolerate her friend as such
And to wait this long to be trusted so
But I cannot wait
I cannot walk
When no progress avails itself to me 
And so I must go

    





Deserted Road

Walking down a road
Without a sight in sight
Isn't knowing
It's trusting 

That at the end of it all
When it all has fallen
That it was worth the walk
Because if not I'd fall

    





Desiration

Though I do not know 
   Where you are at present 
       I want you now more than ever before 
   
More than the ink in my pen
   And the quiet corner of my world 
       (which I also adore)

More...
   Than any father or mother
       Stranger or friend 

Because I want you my other 
   More than life itself 
       Yes, I want your times itself to spend 

On anything and everything
   Our hearts
       Our ears or eyes desire
   
Because I want you more 
   Than even my former self
       In this moment it's you I desire

    





Desire

I want the back of your head
I want the smell of your hair
I dream of it
Or so I've been
Asleep for many years
With arms in shape
But not for me
But to carry the weight
To preserve the strength
To ensure the future of our family
For this desire
For this my soul weeps
And my arm ache
I want you more than I want me

    





Desire that, which we do not have

Desire is a known trait 
To all
  The rich
  The poor
  The sick
  The weak 

No matter where you stand
Or sit 
Or wish
  We all seek

    





Desire To Shift

I want to move you like a day
well remembered
from afar

Short and sweet
your heart to shift
your eyes to reach for another star

My hope is always in 'suchaways'
presented so as not to find
or be guilty of wanting less

I express and play
with the vision just beyond my own

To show you, see you
move enact
such is my desire today

As I want to move you not so far away

    





Detached As You Are Now

Create
   Are you happy now? 
Escape
   Are you something now?  
Engage 
     Are you lacking now? 
Erase 
   Are you nothing now? 
Replace
   Are you growing now?
Keep pace 
   Are you fleeing now? 
Change face
  Are you about now?
Embrace 
   Are you joyful now?

    





Detachment Has A Name Called Me

When the morning is an aging mist 
Which catches deep inside my hollow chest 
Like the sleep brought about once fast and past
Like smoke rings bellowing from a chimney stack 
Ever emptying out

Until sky then holds no hands 
And the earth will not coincide with any of mine 
Once again, and so 
I will not be found, let alone in peace reside  
So long as this morning mist persists in mind 

Detachment has a name called me
I own it, and it is one of mine

    





dichotomy united

Unfeeling, never
Full of feeling always and in being, have been
Don’t call another man by my name 
Or think that I am, without sin 
But the one thing which I know, and am 
Is that and this, and the neither alone 
That I’ll know when one-day heaven has come
And until then you’re my home

    





Difficult

The amount of work this is going to take
Both inside and out, and out again
To build this way
Is significant 

And the sad thing is
I'm not even comfortable enough to say:

"When you're working here
Would you lay these bricks a certain way?
That way I will feel like myself 
When they're underfoot 
In the days to come"</em>

I struggle just to say such things
For fear of the constructed persons way

    





Digging

A sense of self better known? 
Perhaps. 
But in the company of those others found, and in the investment free. These betterments and attempted others, will in time, be. 
Counted as blessings abound, be they only in the attempt. 
In unearthing, we are found or hidden

    





Digging Down

Sometimes when I look at the ground
And see it round
I want to dig so that it's not there
So that what's beneath it is revealed
Is extracted and laid bare
Sometimes when I look at the ground
I want to know evermore so
And in my desire I do not care

    





Dimensions

There is nothing more peaceful
No place more quietly filled with solidarity and truth
There is no smile brighter 
No sound more solemn
And no such expression wasted solely on you
There is more than expected
Midst this endless perspective
There are labels which cannot speak ounces of truth
There is more than that which appears to all else
In this moment I find
There is more than just you

    





Dinkinson Around

A Tolstory was never for me
Nor an ounce of Frost on my fingertips found
In the complexities of Estlin’s dreams, I am 
Not a man without my own Wit
Or Dunbarred from uncaging this, my own sound 
Only to be let loose in a Field of youthful green
No I am nonesuch of these or be Twain
I am a storm to be you see
And here I've just been Dickinson around

    





Dinner For Two Million

One day words will buy me a steak dinner. 
Instead of me buying them another glass of wine.

    





Disassociate

Walk away from everything
Take steps without your feet
Stride as oceans turning break
And stumble upon like fallen leaves

Step-over caution endlessly 
With a rustling wavering ease
And walk away from everything
In your walking you are free

Because only you, yourself can keep
In your walking you are free

    





Disconnection

Careful we
Must always be
Not to isolate ourselves
Because the mind may think
That it's best to fall 
From the reasons of former self
But prepared for such things
Inevitably
Lest we are not
Or never will
Be
Ready to concur the former self
To maximize you
Is to challenge through the eyes
Of me

    





Discovery, An Ocean Of Song

One day a song is there to stay
And the next it fades 
In the memory of sea
Like a courseing wave 
NEW descends upon me 
And then like the tide 
It ebbs away
Never to be found again
Until NEXT appears 
Beneath my sandy feet away
I am born of music

    





Distance

From a distant place
Your echo reaches me here
At this length
Like a drum in my ears
Your memory kiss reverberates 
And shakes my very soul of souls 
Creating in me a sound of old
Which slowly fades
And with anticipation 
Waits
To hear the breath of all which once was told 
Next yours my present face

    





Distant Stars

Dissolve the ceiling above my head 
With an outstretched arm
So that I can speak to the stars again 
Not to say goodbye
Or to say goodnight
But to welcome them back into the darkest corners of my life
So that I can lay here and not feel flat
With my head tipped back to catch the slight
That way I could be in line with you 
Underneath the distant stars tonight

    





Distant, Unwritable

Beyond the borders of this humble kingdom
You are living live
Breathing deep as the morning dew 
And settling into the starry sky 

Most beautiful, wonderful, glorious you 
In awe are my eyes ever found alive 
By the distant singularity which is new 
 And blinding as your sudden sight

    





Distant Wishes Under The Same Sky

Do you feel, do you think, do you pretend for, and still hope to be? Do you try, do you want, do you wish for, and occasionally plead? Do you shine with vibrant wonder, and in dreams cool resolve to be? Free from the sake of those waiting upon you. 

Do you still wish to fall? 
I'm sure you do. But for me?

    





Distractions

I'm so selfish
That I've only wanted my own distractions to distract me

In those ways which I will certainly be
At peace and free

Because time passing alone
Isn't enough to please me

Let alone someone else, near by at present
As it was never meant nor will be

But instead it's the foolish selfish desire
Which I've let govern me, sadly

For more time now than I care to admit
I've called by name, these distractions and me

    





Don't Be With Him

He failed, 
I won't. 
And if he ever tries to say a word, 
Just don't. 

You don't need him, 
And you don't need me. 
Though on your own you don't belong, 
It's beside my side I find you fit,
Most perfectly. 

With someone who cares, 
Someone who tries.
Someone who lets your self be broken. 
Someone who knows that the rain is a direct result of when you cry. 

Don't be with him, 
You shouldn't be. 
I like the rain. 
And I,
Unlike him, 
Simply know how to let it be.

    





Don't Douse Your Inner Flame (Exploratory)

The trick is not .... to drown 
In the saturation of memory ...
        Highly colored 
        Feelings felt 
        Or letters burned in effigy 
The key is .... the feeling of the fiery warmth
And not the dousing of opportunity ...
To make memories anew

    





Don't Even

Don't pretend to be something you're not to impress
Don't be like that 
When in fact it's the claim that you understand 
Which unfailing
Undoubtedly 
Makes me laugh

    





Don't Wait

When the books of bold close cold on you
     And the results bend nether way
With a hopeful truth speak Carpe diem 
     Don’t wait to seize the day

When the months of old turn back to you
     And the dew of springtime stays 
With your shoulders shake the dawn anew 
     In the chaos find a way 

When you’re home to pass midst summers last
     And the memories fade away 
Speak Carpe diem non differas
     Don’t wait to seize the day

When your merit is tested on the field
     And the court of your kingdom sways
When your trialed life becomes the sim 
     In the chaos find a way 

Because you’ll never have what you have now
     And no time will ever stay
This precious, blessed, life to pass 
     Don’t wait to seize the day

    





Don't wait to speak, or call, or try

A wish is only a wish 
When you have not the time -
Or the faculties 
Or the will left alive 
- to try 

Be it again or for the first or for the eventual not

Will you try?

    





Don't Waste Your Life In Dreams (or something)

Whatever imperfect things 
We could possibly share 
They will not compare 
So long as I have
And hold fast to the hope 
Of what perfectly could never be
S O M E T H I N G

    





Doom Heart

My heart has been heavy
And very much aware
Of the smallest value which it brings to the world
And...
No companionship or creativity
Accomplishment or distractions 
Can distract me from this
The inevitability of mortality

    





Downpour

In that moment I am gray as a the clouds until the sky falls down and there is gray all over me, all around and on the ground. 

Do you ever feel such moments my friend? 

When you feel like you are one with the clouds?

    





Dragon Fly Flakes

The kind of flakes which catch your eyelashes and make you blink. 
Obnoxious yet beautiful things. 
The dragonflies of a December night on an April day. 
Yet as close as we are now to May, 
There's no delight in dragonflies of frosted ice.
You catch my eye, 
And land upon my windshield just to be scraped away. 
Goodbye spring day, 
Let us welcome back the winters bite of a dragonfly,
Which flew away.

-SS

    





D R E A M

At each unending end
When the night is darkest fair in the eyes of men
And the sight of it becomes meme
Whisper nothing but dreams
Breathing it's something of value
Into the ears of the dying day behind you

    





Dream Girl

Watching this old movie again,
And hearing her song now like this,
Reminds me having known is enough, 
Because I know that she exists.

    





Dreaming Of The Unknown Known

I want to go beyond your clouded skies
Love deeper than the ocean bed
And lie peacefully beneath the trees of ease
My love and I
Quietly watching the leaves float by

    





Dreams Can Kill (A Haiku)

Dream of your something 
Long enough and you'll die there 
In your bed of made

    





Dreams die fast, sadly

Perhaps you are not as you seem
Or perhaps the problem
As it always has been
Resides with me

For I am my not that
As I'm not angry when awake
But that too often now I have gone to dreams
And dreams don't die for me 

Instead, I breathe 
And in sleeping 
Wake

    





Drink You In

True reflections appeal to me
Like the churning waters of the Atlantic 
I am lost amidst the vastness of this deep blue sea

I think therefor I am and hope that I will ever be
A clever well of reflective waters 
The kind that people always seek

And yet I search for you in streams 
Because I thirst and need to drink 
Your words in deep which comfort and compose the likes of me

No other soul will see you shimmer neath the snow capped mountain peaks
And so I stoop to catch your fragrance 
And drink you in a draught so deep

-SS

    





Driving Away

It is raining, you must be crying. 
I left you on the dark side of a broken highway. 
Just outside of the intersection of time and change. 
You did proclaim that you were afraid that I wouldn't stay. 
That I wouldn't live to see the light of the following day. 

And I didn't. 
You were right.
 
I got in my car and drove away. 
But not because I wanted to. 
But because I didn't feel at home enough to stay. 
How could I possibly find our way, when you were without a map everyday? 
Once alive and bright like the dashboard light. 
I faded away, into the dark of this good night.
 
Yet you never saw the sadness which I kept when I did drive away.

    





Driving Force Of Mine

More than anything
It's not a home that I want
Nor people within
Or stuff
Or responsibility 
No
It's the freedom of such
The desire to begin
And the standing memory which I've yet to know
Which drives my heart forward
Like a turning car
Racing and ever 
Towards new ends

    





Droplets Come and Go

Feelings like rain
fall regularly 
flood haphazardly
and last sparingly

(on this human floor)

    





Drops In A Puddle

Overlapping like our hands
But colder, quicker 
And in an uncontrolled fall
Free until splash, dew part
Truthfully
The rain drops in the puddle there
Are not like us at all

    





Dusk Today

You think I fear you?
Glorious dusk
And the turning of night from the clear of day? 

My dawn arises with a hush
And with a quiet whisper there I find
Amidst the new light narrow way 

Afraid of you, I’m not today
Not today 
O’ Glorious dusk

For the winds of change 
Pick steadily up
And blow you like the chaff away  

Afraid of you, I’m not today
Not today 
O’ Glorious dusk

My fears the light has whisked away 
Far away from every fright
I fear no glorious dusk today

    





Dying Leaves, Flying As A Haiku

Leaves learn first to fly
Once the test of death behind
Is last in their sight

    





Dynasty

There was a time when I was broken
When I was down and waiting out 
Watching others wear my crown 
And waiting silently in wings 

A folded self just asking why
Trusting in healing found in years of time

I outwaited all those demons  
Turned my enemies to friends 
And then for ages, they looked on
As we won again, and again, and again

Sometimes you are the only problem
Sometimes the time is all you need
Sometimes the losses build the victor 
No dynasty is meant to be 

You have to make it
Happen

    





Each End That Was Meant

When his shoulders turn and all hope is falling, like an iron on steel, like the rain in May. There will be no tomorrow for the us which was, for the walk which couldn't be kept away.

    





Each Morning

From the moment I wake
And stop breathing haste beneath ceiling fans
How I wish to create
Though I cannot always due to morning fog
And its mind over me
How it strongly takes
Two cups at least

    





Ease Up, Unpleasant Self

Tired and cold
Self-doubting self 
In search of mind away 
From noon else 
Like someone who you care about
Treat well yourself 
And in your own way
Kind

    





Easy Is Already Finished

In any fight there is a breath 
In every battle a sky soaring innocently overhead 
Watching us make mindless decisions 
Every day upon days unend 
We sleepily forget as if anew has begun 
When really if it were easy to do
It would already have been done

    





Eater Of Life

Swallow the moon
Consume the ocean
Kick over the mountains eternally

Fresh like coffee
Old like stars
Picking at teeth with a redwood tree

When he's like this
Standing tall and lean
It's not about HE

It's about the fire and the flames
Fanned insatiably
Finally

For as giants fall like stones in sun
So also will he wreck the earth 
Until the valleys and the peaks are one

Leveled
Swallowed
Insatiably

Eater Of Life
Immense 
Is he

    





Ebbing

The water with its honest breath
And the inevitability therein
Will always waiver with the tides
And bring such truth back to me
Like a tempest, with ebb, it begins

    





Echo

Today 
Off the western side of the eastern trees
Bounced back my feelings
And for the first time
Echoed throughout, inside of me
And I am appalled by what I heard
Not what I see

    





Ecstation

Sometime you need to come close
And say no
To what you would be happy with
In order to find
What you will be ecstatic with

    





Edges (A Tanka)

Hovering where here
On the edge of a mountain 
Holding steady fast
A tired high, a subtle cliff
A calling fall which rings out

    





EEC

A man can write
For 58 years
( And ) 

Have his legacy contained
In less than two inches
( It is a crime )

    





Electric Skies

One day a new energy burned in the sky 
Bright as the sun beasts eyes
And just as strong as this wind engine of mine
And I could see it, finally
Though it had always been

    





Elimination Day

Today is not a day for fear
For questioning doubt or considering guilt
Today, though just another day, draws near
And means more than you could ever count
Don't wait to make your impact today
Don't let yourself sit or be counted as out
Take time and focus with an energetic mix
And with confidence write your future out

A pen is meant to be seized, today

    





Elliots

Contrast
Is a fine line
I walk everyday
Goodfellow and me 
Precariously

    





Embrace

Welcome change
Embrace its embrace
And you will grow new
In spite of the length 
Of your shadowy face

Because long is the short
Of the time in this place
And though changes are made
At a self-perceived pace 

We are meant to endure 
We are meant to take place
Would you welcome the change?
In all of it's uncomfortable embrace

    





Embrace Like This

I hope that one day
She will come to me when she is tired 
Because rest
The pure rest of a resounding peace
Is something which I too desire
And can provide her with

    





Empathetical

Don't judge 
Lest you be judged 
Especially because of feelings felt
If anything you must
Judge due to the inability to feel
To empathize with the burden of others
To feel such crushing weight 
Until you can see the shadow of beneath 
Try painting pictures not of them
But of yourself

    





Empathic

It's not that I have a right 
To avoid it or be scared
Its just that no matter how hard I try 
And ignore it
I can feel the emotions in the air

    





Emphasis

To be <strong>bold</strong> as love 
Is not to fear the alone
As the <strong>italic</em></strong> 
Does not tend to bend so much 
As the mind itself does mold

    





Encompassing Rain Clouds

For just one day
Could the rain clouds cover the entire earth?
Could the rains wash the weariness of another Monday away? 
And connect our hands, our eyes, our hearts? 
To tip the glass and spill the words out, quietly
Until all is spoken and soaked in happiness
And the doubts have all been washed away
Into the flooded pasture of memories 

For we are such on such a day 
But even more so now than ever
That is, if the clouds could cover the entire earth
In which case we could look up and see
That the same old rain falling down upon us, you and me
Smiling as it hit the ground
Until the splashing molding droplets
Are just a memory to be relived 

Let the clouds cover and the raindrops flow
To ever be

    





End Of The Road

You go to the end of the road
And you know 
Immediately what's there
That is why you don't acknowledge the sign
The street
The loop
It leads nowhere

    





Eneye

You'll know him
Or her 
When you see them
A steady person
With an intriguing glance
Masking a world inside

    





Envision And It Will Be So

Think as if JJ Abrams is watching 
Speak as if alone
Be true to you amongst all the sounds 
That way your presence will resound 
And to yourself, you'll always be known

    





Envisioning Contentment

I dare not breathe 
I dare not hope
I dare not try and be
Any less content with this now
To be any less jumping up and down
Would not be true to me

    





Eryn Galen

It's sanded pine
It's endless time
And summers spent 
On nothing at all

It's the graciousness of seasons set
With a perfect fade
In this woodland realm
I'll never fall

    





Eryn's Tanka

Second chances come
Only open to those who
Arriving slowly 
Choose the feeling calling rays
Of sunlit memories felt

    





Escape

Meet me in between the lines 
  Where the voice hums and the mind hides 
     Most adamantly 
        Away from these
Distract me until this most recent death
   Is dead to me
And hug me still 
   Until I'm still
   Until all that’s left is the music and us
   Until, until
My earbuds hums and burst with song 
    And shatter my drums 
         Because these other songs are too sad for me

    





Eternal Battle

No matter how many people I build up
Or desperate towers I tear down
With the beautiful brutal honesty of humans
It is only the cannot that is felt
When it comes to the understanding built
Between two me's
There is a difficult us to be found

    





Eternal Mystery (Acrostic)

What is the greatest mystery known to man?
On any rock, be it this one or the next?
Making male minds skip at times, like tracks 
And yet most always welcoming, whenever it is that they</em> want you back
Never mind the initial question in mind, need I even ask?

    





Even The Night Has Feelings Too

When feelings are a night sky
And the darkness is all around you found
Keeping out with little window lights
Your prerogative is even clearer now
Than to those around 
As I am the night sky reincarnate

    





Even When Tired, Must Travel

A stretched of highway in my forehead 
A road to travel 
I will, must 
Be it conscious or in sleepness 
I too shall go
I will
I must

    





Ever Changed

Carve the heart out from its walls
Drain the kindness from its veins 
Change absolutely nothing at all
But remove the heart, and baby, it’ll die
Because the heart of that place was everything 
Good and wholesome, below the sky

    





Everflow

I am the kind of person who
For a moment cannot stand to sit
For I must always in doing do
Just as always I am and never one with it

    





Evergrow

No person can evoke such change
In one's self left alone, I say no
Because to grow, truly grow
Is to know that you yourself
Have all that which you need 
To do incredible things, today
Be it just to begin, again and again
To walk forward into the future
Everso slow

Never the less you can go

    





Every Battle, Ever, Ends

When all my battles are won and done
I will not fear the fight that was
So why worry about the swing of the sword
Before the sun of that day is even in my eyes
Why worry indeed

    





Everyone

Everyone believes in something

That they are the one
That they are someone
That they are nobody 

Everyone believes in something

    





Everyone Is Someone

How quickly we confer 
Judgment upon those people 
Who are not ourselves

Whole people
Like whole oceans and mountain ranges

Broken people
Just like ourselves 

Who are we to judge and to bestow
Such hasty blows  
Upon such people

    





Everything Bread By The Sea

Take me back,
Wash away my worries
And drown me in memories
Of everything bread by the sea.

    





Everything Girl

Let it be known
That the sweetest nothing I ever tasted, was you

More light and charming than a sunset Summer
More distant and wonderus than a reflective star

You were first in mind
And last for me in many things

My distant, charming, everything
Girl

    





Everything Or None At All

Give me the ocean 
Or not a single drop

Give me time
Or not even a moment to stop

Give me every glimmering evening star 
Or none at all

Give me fire from my finger tips 
Or no more sparks left to fall

Give me everything or none at all
Give me all of you before I fall

    





Excerpt From An Old Journal

No matter how hard we fight...
Natures rain falls regardless...
Even if we hide.

    





Exhale The Old Life Lived

Fragile as a city streetlight 
Quiet as the flickering night 
And falling like the pale moonlight

My love will breathe its final breath 
With an exaltative hale 
And hiss 

My words a mist 
Will die with me 
In a bed that's not my own perhaps 

This layered earth my pillow rest 
And with a quiet mind
Lay me down to be 

For I am no longer here you see
And these words once left
Remark so little of me  

To my fathers' house
Go the most perfect and unexplainable sounds
The voice I found is free

    





Existence. Is. Obviously.

One day you'll walk 
Though the same old door
Into a world unchanged 
Only to discover the truth

That nothing is ever the same
That no second ever failed to fly
And that all is the essence of obvious 
Even you

    





Expectations (4LINE)

Skies too small and colorless
Waters too calm and chaos intent 
The earth too round, too bound and true
Too much my hopes for you

    





Experience

You bade me come
Like blades of grass and shields of rye 

Like wind in mountain meadows past
Like sun and moon and sky

Your hand outstretched a breath from mine 
Midst mire known to sink 

I reached
And took you in with a sight so deep 

You bade me come alive

    





Experiencing You

I hear it as jazzing sound
And see it as a breathing sigh 
The snowfall and its white feather down
Both light and bright as a once darkened sky 

The distant stars drowned out by the day
An aesthetic row of these ancient books
To hide is not part of the mountains way
All it takes for this one is a look 

And I am lost beyond horizons
More cold than hollowed ocean nooks
Just as the breeze brings gifts
And rgis wish by a field to sow 

I hear and see all this alive 
And about you I wish to know 

That it was

    





Experiential Self

I, 
can-not will-not would-not,
did

When an older you, 
knew should but, 
didn’t

    





Expressions

No metaphor will tell it
Although I convince myself within the moment
That it will last

That the clouds above my head
The howling wind which I adore
The summer rain and the glorious morn
Will indeed last

But they never do

Because no metaphor can contain
Or stretch it over the canvas to fit
Or even begin to properly paint
This representation known as you

You simply are, as simply is
Beyond the metaphor
Within the shadow of a moonlit truth

    





Exuberant Joy

I could fly
Though I can't

I could sing
Without sound

I embrace
The dancer named exuberance

And follow her here
Amidst the internal

Spinning like the clouds 
Round and round

    





Eyelight

When I see your eyes, I take my time
I look beyond the color scheme 
The imperfect stare
And the awkward potential there 
Shared inbetween 

When I look at you, nothing else exists 

When I look at you, I see

    





Eyes Over Steaming Cup, A Tanka

It's a simple smile
Softly over a small cup
Of steaming coffee
Which cries almost quietly 
"Joy alive in crinkled eyes"

    





Eyes Wide Closed

When the eyes see trees and not possibilities.

A future that is not beyond tomorrow.
A person instead of a lover, or another.

When all of these things, in closing eyes see...

Then ones line of sight is oriented properly.

    





Failure, A Haiku

Whoever fails not
But embraces self-doubting
Fails growth first at birth

    





Fairer Weather

Echo
In an empty room
No sun is there but you

Smile
At a day of gloom
No cloud escapes the moon

Wither
At a daily pass
No dream was meant to last

Wild 
As the dreams may be
No one will last for me

    





...Faith

There is a warming hope
within the soul
above the heart
behind the mindful eyes of late
Foundational as it is warm
And kind as it is great
Nonreligious as I mean true
And simple as a childs love
You know that I'm referring to?
It's...

    





Faith Beneath

Just a blind man can have faith
In the firmness of world beneath his bed
So also will I believe in steadfastness of my God
And that I will arise anew each day
To begin again

    





Faithful

Do you doubt that the dawn
Will arise anew? 
After the hours 
In between?

Do you doubt that God
Will not cover you?
With his pinons 
As his wings?

For as a child of little
Be full of faith.
And of faithfulness 
Indeed.

For as the sun
Each day,
Decides to flee
So our God will never leave.

    





Faith Gives More

Faith makes faces shine 
Like crumpled tin sheets in the sunlight

Gives the backing of Giants
To those once considered meek

And shows one's own ability to believe
In all that ever could be

Faith brings both warmth and luminosity
To the cold, small, twisted mind of man

    





Faith Is

Faith
Is looking into the darkness
Knowing that it's not sea, but sky
And trusting that there are stars

Trust 
Is an outreached hand on high
Knowing that no such embrace will come
But grace, will arise

And choice
Is the soul struggling inbetween 
Weather or not to believe
In all which exists beyond our own eyes

    





Faith Of Man

Without (faith)

There is no sky to fall .
No earth to stand .
No breath to breathe .

Without (faith) 
My self .
Isn't me .

    





Fall Asleep With Me

The smell of skin
Alabaster 
Mixed with deep breaths in the dark 

As quiet minds
Slowly unwind
And let go of the thoughts inside
Like shooting stars
We fall in line
Most quietly here side by side 

Within this bed
All that could've been said
Has faded like the setting sun
At least until the morning comes
Until you smell the coffee 
And hear the distant purring hum 
Of the ceiling fan
Let your heart beat slow until we speak again 

Because there is no safer place
No secluded cabin or basin by a mountain face

There is only you 
And there is only me
And the edges of what cannot be seen

Like the trust we keep in each other
So completed
Which results in an expert exclusivity

So you know that when I say I can
I mean thay I will indefinitely 
As you know that you could for me

Because no other eyes can see
The certain way the palmtrees sway 
Longingly beside the sea

So if you ever desire to sleep
While lying right here next to me

I wouldn't mind such a memory 
In fact I'd cherish it, hold onto it 
And try my best to forever keep
The essence of your tiny feet
As they passed by my awkward knees

Provided you don't mind my skin
Or the smell of my cologne which I always keep
For as surly as the sun will peak 
Near by my side is where you'd be

And slowly as you succumb to sleep 
And drift into a pleasant dream
I'd close my eyes and be at peace
Just knowing you were next to me

There in the dark 
Where our deep breaths meet
Is where I hope you'd fall asleep

    





Falling (A Tanka)

As summer leaves leap
Out of trees and river mouths
Broken stars reign down
Like a tripping set of stairs
Out of saturated clouds

    





Falling Dreams

And suddenly 
It is 

Like the twisting snow or shifting rain
Out of nowhere falling 
And on you in a new way
As if you are waking for the first time in another bed of life
From a dream which your former self must've intended to stay

Awake and suddenly 
You are

    





falling hopes from foreign skye

My heartache aches 
In a streaking falling façade of a homeless soul about-face 

Like ink dropped strains across a dripping chest 
Revealing no tissue but the clouds and clouded paints 

Like a comet dying in the atmospheric life of nothing 
Tempting no one to look, but everyone under the sun to see 

My hair above me and in moonlight come alive 
At the electric touch of your skylight fingers 

find me

    





Falling Into Words

You can set up all the pins
Set aside all the time in the world to try 
And still fail at being
And in that failure of self
Be
And it's alright 

No bird without falling ever first learned to fly
And so will you
With word

    





Falling Leaves

If I were but a falling leaf, I wouldn't care for anything. 

My life would be played out on the breeze, and falling short would not be such a shame. 

If I were but a falling leaf. 

I'd leave my parents lengthy tree, and fall to the ground, yes I would leave.

And during the fall I would flutter with glee, as I descended down, and just before I hit the earth, I'd look up to the sky and see. 

If I were but a falling leaf.

I would mold my edges to catch the wind, and drift upon the gusts of change, most happily.

If I were but a fallen leaf.

I would greet the Earth upon the ground, and curl my corners to the sky, to soak the rain and drink so deep. 

If I were but an autumn leaf. 

The sound of the wind would not mean change. But that another journey has just begun, and that I and the journey are one and the same.

If I were to fall like an Autumn leaf. 
I hope that I would be the same.

    





Falling Rain

My voice is in the falling rain
A crashing rolling weeping realm 
My song of storms proudly proclaims
These clouded skies are falling down 

Back to the earth from whence they came 
A moist collection careening down 
To crash into the waterways 
And sing my song clear and aloud

Into your ears I whisper rain
And share my secrets so profound
As droplets cleanse the concrete stains
They sweep away the sorrow sounds 

So here I sits by window panes 
To smell the sky and taste the clouds 
Though thunder rolls and storms berates
My song remains like falling sounds

    





falter and falling

We 
     the leaves 
     the snow 
     the rain flow 
We all 
     fall

    





Fame Makes Friends In Odd Places

I would wish fame
Upon a friend turned enemy
If only so that one day
They would walk back into town
And find 
The one true me waiting to hear
All about it

    





Family Trees

These trees are older than myself 
And only half of them see the sun 
As it sets beyond the distant ground
They're taller than me and I am tall
They've been reaching for the sky for far too long
Long before I could even crawl
My only brother's are these trees
And yet I've never acknowledge them as they are
As tall and faithful
As my slowly falling family
The kind of trees which stand to be 
Such are these looming trees to me

    





Fat Cat

Let the fat cat, from the alley back, in philly ****. And scatter all of the mice and men, who dare and defy the logic that, his impact, is in fact, where it's at.

    





Fated Notes and Letters

On quiet little corners turned
And freshly folded blackened ink
Beneath pillows raspy, hands left grasping
And above all thoughts which were recently freed

There are pages stating and there is change
As there is fire waiting for the freedom to be

Pleasnt quiet little corners turned
Burn
Though you once had held a candle to me

    





Father, Son

Someday very soon
I’ll look back through the eyes of memory at you 
And remember when you made your world yours 

Dry as ink 
I’ve yet to write

    





Father Tundra

If God is a tundra, with seasons turning fast
like flowers, growing from the ground, or
flowing like snow from the falling sky
Like a building, God, is built powerful and
strong, and I not to last
Though a tundra knows no sympathy but
time, and yet, with Spring the Winter's grasp
will always pass

    





Fear

Fear is not more costly than loss
And in finding that we cannot fly 
Half so well as we like to think about
Let alone try
It is the grounded meaning and by which
That we learn of the proportioned sky above

    





Fearnot Unwinding Threads

Fear no
Being
Or lack
Of existence 
Un

For you were
Meant to be
Exactly as
You have been
Thus far

Undone

    





Feathers In My Hair

I move so fast 
That the birds have stopped nesting in my hair 
This year

    





Feeling Alone, Might Leave

Feeling the winding springs beneath 
Gravitational pull indefinite
Might leave now
Definitely

    





Feelings

More ups and downs
Highs and lows
Ins and outs
All around
With thoughts abound which fall like snow to melting grounds
Citizens Cope play me out
Because knocking me sideways is what this life is all about

    





Feelings, A Haiku

Feelings personal 
So much so unknown to self
Still they want to grow

    





Feelsworth

Waves, cutting snow, soaring star beams incomplete 
From the ocean lows to the burning hot asphalt sharp beneath
And in running these risers with both fire and ferocity shown 
Burn brighter than moons and more fervently than fires 
Over a misty river breath breathed out all at once alone 
Just as rings of power are now deadened by time
I cannot even begin to describe 
These feelings of mine

    





Fervently

Quicker than the blink of a Firefly
Brighter than the summer days and nights
Quieter than a Brook trouts breath
And more beautiful than the gradient sky
Are the words which I've yet to hear from you
But look forward to
Most fervently

    





Fever

When day becomes night and night becomes day
And the woods are silent with seeping snow
Heavy on the branches, you'll know
The feeling of hot and cold
And the fever which drains your time away
Which you'll never get back 
The old, the cold

    





Fever Want

It's easy to be most confident
When the action is present
When the purpose is known
But give yourself nothing but time to see
Nothing but quite days of drifting snow
And there in the waiting you will find
That the precious thing which you wanted most
Was just another line of string
In a wrapped up life slowly being unrolled

    





Fickle Want

WANT is such a fickle thing
Worth no more than prior words
Spent unwisely in the spinning of a slot machine

Cash out while you can?
Better instead, to not play with that which you do not believe

Better yet, indeed

    





Fighter

When spirits are roused
Minds set afire
And dust sent flying by the awakened feet
Hands aching for action
Not just for resistance or victory
Not for power or blood
Nor for conquest or feast
No, such hunger growls due to the inaction of man
From the settling sunlit rays of dust
From the empty corridors
From rememberance of fire being felt beneath the feet

    





fighting against the chronic heartache

You'd sooner see the ease of shaking the trees 
and demanding that the leaves fall 
(prematurely)
rather than rushing to find 
She who was not ready to be found

    





Filter, A Tanka

Let there be words found 
Midst accompanying song
Joyous actions too 
Abound with simple light stroke
In this artistry complex

    





Finding You True

Stop picturing yourself 
As happier somewhere else
And focus on finding 
The most joyous you
In what is currently true

    





First Fall

Your raven hair
A recollection now
Like the memory flown before your own

In the storm-lands flat as gasping chest 
Your ghost was static on my fingertips 
A whirlwind in my inland mind 

How your wingless thoughts and seamless ways 
Taught me to fly 
On that fateless day

    





First Sip

When they make my drink
With exuberance liquified 
And season, in its entirety, personified 

Regardless of the turning days
Or the morning upside 
So much, so down

When they make my drink
I can hardly blink
In raptures taste makes me want to smile

    





First To Strike A Match

Doors close like conversations
Cold as attics below basements
So we are an abandoned home
Until I light a candle and rekindle
Always me

    





Fish

No soulmate exists
For a man such as this
No soulful hands grasping to find

For as long as such choice
Has been given unto us
Noone trusts souls enough ere to find

    





Fishing

Cast out the mind
Of the thinking self
Splash and reel
In the quietest version of life

    





Fitzwilliam

As Fitzwilliam was
And said
Now I've only to be ashamed of what my own have been

    





Five Lines Of Fire

Lifted up from an ocean death
You breathed into my chest a breath
And gave me fire from the sun to glow
Thunder in the ears of me
And lightning bolts to throw

    





Five Of Five

By my own hand, self-oblivion comes. 
By my own mind, undone or wound. 
By a question asked, all is lost of found.
By opinion shared, around.

    





Flakes

As snow descends unto the earth 
With a calming, soothing, effortless ease

So you my friend should be like the snow 
And settle the horizon beyond the trees

No snowflake was ever meant to last
Or to live to see the newborn leaves 

For we are uniquely designed by God
As unique and beautiful as these

    





Flakes Like This

Large snow
Flaking and falling
Like eye lashes
Eww

    





Flame Inextinguishable

Every time
I think that I’m really though with you

I laugh at the irony 
Exclaim, but not in exuberance 
My heart races, only to fade

And a headache follows 
With my realized mistake 

Every
Single 
Time

Why do I look?

    





Flash Flay

Missing the spark of your flash in the pan
The blinding seering light most quick
I miss
Not the way I'd behave when things would go amiss
No
I miss the fog of war
The flashing flay
And the feeling of victory
That most ignorant bliss
The spark
The flash
The flay is what I miss

    





Flight, A Haiku

I grasp for such words 
On tempered wires perched like birds
But they fly away

    





Flightless Sentiments

I knew that I was not a bird
I knew it when I fell and I
A wingless thing 
An ageless life
Angelless on this ended line
Known to me no bird was I
Long before I couldn't fly

    





Flooded

On this tabletop we sit, soaking bodies weighted down.

Overturning back and forth, arm in arm, alone in town.

Rushing water pouring in and spinning round, pounding down.

Inside of this house and out. Turmoil rises up, and gathers all around. 

Listen to the hallways hum, and hear the words escape my mouth.

Like a song you sing aloud, speaking of a hiding place where you belong.

Echoing, my old guitar is crying out.

Asking if within the flood we ever will at last be found?

    





Floridians (A Tanka)

Yet Towards Winter 
We are drawn in surreal
Running South away
Our feet acknowledging that
Which we fear the most alone

    





Flower

Some flowers wither
Others bloom better
Far away from the garden of perpetual care
The father, the mother
The assaulting, influential weather

    





Flower Beth

Of all the flowers a bee could breathe
And visit in secret
Without nest or nectar knowing
You all the opposite of calm and to be expected 
Smell sweetly dulcet and intoxicating 
Being ever drawn back like a buzz
As only you could ever be

    





Flowing from to from

I drift from hopeful skys above, into the honest truth of my hubris below. As easily as, and as flowing as, a river flaked with this northern snow. How slowly I go, so as not to freeze. Yet I fall past Fall irrevocably, I, cannot stay - let alone forever in this clouded sky. And so, back to my own groundings I go. Adrift from my home and hopeful highs above, into the valleys I've know best, below.

    





Flowing Words In Falling Skies

Kiss me like the moonlit stars, reflect and reach the Everglades, and embue with blue like the Sunday shade. Cool, crisp, refreshing, and new.

Don't cut my leaves and curb my bite, to melt me into pasty walls of glowing white. Which will only hold the captured light of the sun which shines to rise.

Don't let me fall without a trace. To meet my end in the shallowing streams of fading grey, where I could never dream of meeting thee, with such a wave. 

But take my greeting in from rooftops as a simple sign of life to stay, and fall like stars of burning Orr if you must. Frozen until crashing down, only catch me along the way.

    





Fly Fishing At Dawn

The wild sigh
How it wavers and whips
Through the freshly cut sky
No man to see
Or to follow it
As it flees 
And it fly's
Like a harvest scythe
Beneath the gentle breeze
It cracks 
And whips
Stiring the sleeping mouth beneath
With it's shadowy eyes
How the fisherman 
Doth crave the catch
So also does escape
The fly

    





Flying

I can almost contend
Almost swear
That I don't age at all
Not even for a second 
During those moments when I'm in the air

Flying freely without face
Until gravity pulls me back again 
And greets me with a firm embraces 

How I adore such things
Like the feeling of what it's like to soar
Quietly through the clever air 

With a cutting figure bend the back
And unwind with time 
Just to pause for a moment precariously 
And hover right there in the air 

How flying always makes me feel
That I am lighter than the world

Pressing down no more on me
For I am falling between my cares

    





Focal Point

Walk slow
Think fast
Tilt your head 
Slightly back

Focus in 
Fade out 
All the noise 
From the crowd

Step back
Seek out
Breathe in 
And out doubt 

Process
This now
Focal point
Is how

    





Focus Mind

My focus is my blessing
Is my curse 
My constant companion 

Aware of this regressing 
Eye 
And forms of art perception

This is true
This is you

That what I recall is but focal point
Of when reality is you

    





Fog Like Wine

A riesling fog
Rolls back like fingers
From the base of the Alleghenies 

And I 
In watching still
Call forth no words to move as it

    





Foolish Youth

Remeber when we were young?
When we thought we could light the world on fire with our tongues?
When we could lose ourselves in one another and we didn't care?
About anything...
So young 
So dumb

    





For A Sunlit Second

Serene moment
You of feelings people felt
Dont leave me on this Sunday imperfect 
Your warm my soul
You calm my mind
In you I am happy with myself
If but for a single sunlit time
I feel and felt

    





Foremost

I cannot see outside of me
Just as I cannot see the other side of the other screen
Or the person who might admire my words
Or just how they might even appear to be

But this is fine and alright with me
Because foresight flows most equally
Both to and from the truth within
Until such truth is know to me

And just as I might never see
The person who reads my poetry
There is something refreshing inside of me
Like an inherent truth reminding me

That only the readers who I let see
Will ever get a chance to be
Within that certain sight in question
First and foremost, as it appeared to me

    





Foreplay Words

More direct than ***
In personal space to be found
F.  I.  N.  D.
Is mind to mind
Eye to eye
And soul for having found in each others parts the whole

    





Forest Dreams From City Heights

Fields ache to be remembered 
Just as moons howl and kernels crack 
And waters bubble into rivers 

Wide the view of the passing deer
Of the night so strong 
That cold thoughts can endure forever

    





Forget Me Not

My temples ache inside my head
With a need to be without a thought
No one to speak what cannot be said
My quiet calm forget me not</em> 

A storm I carry on my back
Midst howling gale and winters plot 
A weighted mass atop me sits
An eerie calm forget me not</em> 

A flame of hope inside I keep
To thaw that frozen long forgot
Until the first light left is last
A chilling calm forget me not</em> 

Though slowly do the seasons pass
These words embed like branded hot
So be it present or in past
Remember still and *forget me not

    





Forgottenisms

If you loved me - then - it's not me
I've already come and gone and went

    





For Her Beside

A yawn is not that 
But an invitation to,
With sleepy eyes, wish

    





ForSureLand

In the land of ForSure
It doesn’t matter who you were
How late you slept, or quietly wept 
Midst walking storms
No, in such a place as these and this
The only present matter is willingness
To take the words of a fellow man
To tie your shoe with gentle care
And to RUN with it
Into the glorious dawn of a brand new day
Of a new you who isn’t afraid of sunlit truth
And divine ray 
I say, step a little bit closer to your future today

    





For The Morning Cold

Coffee so cold that it cuts through the dark like the moonlit rays’ mere hours before 
The feeling of fog which should not last and could not for long  
No song for this, bask in quietness 
For awakenings upon do not belong

    





For Those Who Feel

If I'm too busy for you
I'm too busy for me
And that is unhealthy

Because perhaps in vain and vainity
We are the same? 

Skilled at creating for someone else
At adapting for the US entirely

But could it be that within the entirety
That we lose the ability to see?

Like the blinders of love 
Be they ever imposed
By this realization of who is me?

Perhaps we are the same indeed?
Perhaps one day you'd let me try 
For you, as also you could for me?

    





For those who think, wonder, and wait

The most difficult part of being 
Is to be

    





For Want Of A Bite

Sometimes I can feel 
The words swimming beneath the surface
But they will not rise
To the fly of me

Maybe a nymph tomorrow

    





Forward Light

Into the sun
I walk 
Without fear of shadows cast
Without thought
Which could potentially fault
Or hinder my step

It is forward
And with purposeful passion
That I stride 
With confident eyes
With the glorious dawn
Which turns its day
Into glorious dying light

    





Forward My Awake

Only those
Who have no regrets
Have also no breath
Left or mind to fathom the why
Awake

Death and worry go hand in hand

    





For You

Perhaps if I were taller
Standing out more so in a stagnant crowd 
Even as PENN DOT lines during a crooked July
Or with deep sweet swallows of pride able to drink in the clouds 

Or if I could sing and lull with just my eyes  
If I were mean or kind 
Or less drunk with proud 
Or loud about if I could bench well over my own weight in pounds 

Maybe if I cared more, or cried often sometimes 
Or didn’t have the willpower to step aside 
And stop fixing things for the millionth time 

Maybe then, and if 
I looked more like him through your eyes 
Then maybe I’d be more or less, motivated to try

    





Found On A Couch

The deepest thing I ever experienced
...
Was a couch most comfortable
Found in a town which adopted me
Like a native sound
...
And most comfortable now, I be

    





Four

Driving in the seat of choice 
we are legacy makers 
and dynasty warriors 
No-one tells us that we cannot 
Only talks about what-we did

    





Four Bigger Words

I want you back?
<strong>I openly laugh</strong>
I’d like to have you at all 
Because *that</em> would be the end of *that

    





Four Of Five

Stars never wander, just as waves never falter. All in crashing, plummeting, omnipotent agonizing, no. No downward motion was ever known, by any of these, such as me.

    





Freckles

Like the luminous points beyond the sky and on the screen
I see the stars just below your eyes
Winking quietly back at me

    





Free

Free is not always true of you
Just as you were not always in being true
With your heavy water, steel, and stone
A building soul is never built 
Or in mind first being with others freed
One day you'll learn all of you is me

    





Freedom Of Opinion Is A Flag In The Wind

Flying through the crisp air
Waving like my freedom fine

In declarative mind
This is for you 
Because I believe the opposite
That somewhere between your extreme and my distaste
Lies the truth

This is what I find

    





Freedom Though Writing To Noone At All

After gravity fades
And the crowds die away
And all that's left is me
And I'm finally free
Not to sleep, or be scared, or be anything 
But me
When I write like this right
For just a moment
I am free
And for an instant I feel
That there's no wrong in me

I am free

    





Free indeed

Mountain airs
Beautiful trees
Unending ridges
Or winding seas

The colorful furns 
The flowery bees
The fallen rains
Or the whispering leaves

No looks 
No sights
No sounds 
Nor scenes 

Can ever keep me from my words
Or yours from my eyes and hopeful promise to me
That if written or not
One day I'll be free

    





Friday Nights

Drink love with me
In wine with me
Unwind with me
As we dance around my living room 
Where the only the only two people who matter 
Can see

    





From A Distance

Behind the mask of distant past 
Where the memories still mill abound

Within the frame of paper mache
Where the words, oh yes, the words can be found 

Beneath the eyes, below the cheeks 
Is a smile ever winding down 

And I am but one such memory, perhaps
As a word once kept around

    





From An Emphatical Man

It's not that opinions
(much like rushed sculptures)
Are always unattractive 
But it's the forceful hatred behind the hands
Which makes me sick of seeing the resurfacing you
Over and over
Again and again 

And yet in this stage of life
I dont hate you
Nearly as much as you hate them

    





From Distant Shores (a tanka)

There is but one heart
Between these two lighthouses 
When the seas connects
And with both lightning and bliss
They reach each other feeling

    





From Now Till Far Away

And then suddenly
Like the dawn, she was there
And my face alight with a joy so bright
That she was even more radiant 
In the second sun of my reflected 
Impervious to shadows and the nets they weave
I am glad that I waited through the night 
To be greeted by my dawning eyes such as these
I am glad

    





From One Christmas To Another

Close 
Far
Warm breath
Cold air burning beneath southern stars

Quiet
Noise
A comforting voice
In ears at last a presence being, my present

    





From The Bottom

Feel the sand beneath your feet
See the waves above your head
Like the pressure in your heart 
So deep
You’re the only one who gets to see
The sea this way 
As it is
Crashing, rolling, underneath 
How you stand beneath the oldest beast 
Ever to be brought down upon the earth

    





From The Clutches of Delete

This poem needed an outstretched hand
To save it from defeat 

So I laid me down on broken cliffs 
And simply reached

To save these words from quiet worlds

I... will not... delete

    





From The Shadows

My heart is in the shadows, 
Though my eyes are on the sky.

Full of light, aware of darkness, 
Amidst these hallways where I hide. 

Behind the walls and whitewashed doors,
My alter ego the other side. 

A phantom man I have ignored, 
A different person I've entwined. 

A gentle guy who gives you things,
The grounded soul which yearns to fly. 

And though the shadows slowly seep,
It's here they meet and coincide.

To form the future and the present, 
To sort the truth and dispel lies. 

Because in the shadows I've risen,
But in the light is where I'll rise.

    





Frustration

What threatens and congests my chest
Is neither feeling nor felt 
But frustration at the April snow 
At the frozen tendencies of me
Which move so slow
And yet, never for the life of them, seem to melt 
Frustrating is this man called me

    





Funny Thing (Old Fires)

I no longer have an old hearth to fire
An old flame to blow out
Let alone coal to kindle

I let all of those old memories go
Out and cold long ago 
With my youthful desire

I've made way for you, future
So that I could burn anew

I wait 
And wait anew

    





Genuine Others

A wonder for one
Is there someone? 
Waiting to massage your shoulders
And to see you smile
When it's not for others 
But for yourself?

Is there dinner waiting
And a willingness willed?
To serve when the service
Has all but ended?

What is the sound of when
There is no public ear?
Is your voice for real
Or just for retail?

Because the shoulders ache
In the service of others
As all smiles do tire 
On the road to work

But hands, kind hands
Have the kindness to admire
How they wait to be held
How they want to hold

    





Getting to know, this such, a mind like your own

If you knew me, you'd know
And in such feelings be felt
More than a stranger passing by
More than a simple smile
Or an almost unexpected sound 

In the real you would live
And out with expectations you'd breathe
Until your lungs were filled
With more than just speculation 
And your thoughts were more honestly bound
(By such realism) and no longer free 

And if I began wandered here less around
Without the knowing's of so
And in my mind decidedly worried less 
And started more committing to find
There's no knowing where or here or when
Our future together would commence to go 

All I know is that this and in this way
(Towards the sky)
We must both more than wish in order to grow 

But then again, if you knew me …
You'd know

    





Ghosts Don't Have Feet, But They Will Run From Me

No ghosts ever ran
And I'm not afraid

Bring on the dark-wind furious beasts
And the sounds of unseen terrors to-night

For I and I will answer with ease
That the heartbeat of a thousand drums 
And the focused ice of perfect clarified unity 
Waits for you day beyond this dawn

Know this 

I am the embodiment of this deity be 
Which wills itself from the earth to leap into the sky and fly
And never falls unless it's willingly done so

And thus it goes
That the deepest storm isn't always shown above the waters
This I cannot say but know

That no ghosts ever ran but from me
It will be so

    





Ghosts Leave No Footprints (A Haiku)

Footprints running thin
Is a heavy weight lifted 
From my following

    





Gibberish

Expansive un
O' mind unkind

Prestigious thought 
Occurs to who?

My never where
O' not of which 
Mine unto you

    





Gifts

Give me quiet ambition.

Give me blank space and lines.

Give me jazz like cold coffee to cool this hot headache of mine.

Give me presence most impartial.

Give me back peace of mind.

Give me time but not too much of it.

Give me only what's mine.

    





girl Dream

When I least expect
Your presence to be
Without longing or desire
Or conscious choice
Without all of these
Some mornings you'll appear
Out of fog and vale revealed
Almost sudden without warning or iniquities 
You aree simply there
And I'm left wondering as to why
You chose once again to visit me
Not in the real but the realm of dreams

    





Give And Take

Give me iron
And I'll give you structures

Give me thunder
And I'll give you storms

Give me raindrops falling on an empty beach
And I'll give you a song like never before

Give me one
And I'll give you all

Give me time
And I'll give you naught

Give me the knowledge of what your human heart desires
And I'll give you my every waking thought

Human as this practice may be or not
It is give and take between be taught

    





give me a bedtime sometimes

can we just stare into each others eyes again
and not know all of the things which — seem to be
but — have always been?
















it's 3 a.m. again, friend.

    





Head In The Sea

How hard is it to soar?

When you've set yourself at the bottom of the ocean
Cross-legged on the crossing grains 
To wait for different wings to sprout

How hard is it to soar?

    





Heads Nodding On A Plane

A waivering head
With memories coursing though every finger
A grip on sleep once lost 
Is held directly in hand
Though it cannot hold a candle to the perfect dark
But to pay the waking watchman's toll
Over and over again
Is no good for a weary traveler stead
Instead it's said, once lost in dreams
Such a peaceful hopeful magnificence 
May be never found again
Let alone remembered upon awaking

    





Headspace

High ceilings breathe better
Walls of nothing or all
Speak loudly without ever having to scream

With balance hinting at perplexity
And a defining edge to rest your head
Surrounded by most of these

Just as the minds eye needs a self reflection to see
And the breath within needs also to breathe

Outward
Honest
And openly up

And such high ceilings are perfect for these

    





Hearing the thoughts of all others as winds

This tall ivory tower itself 
Would will itself to fall
If it understood and heard
The winds of all thoughts
Rushing here around

We were meant to be stone
Meant to be (in our oneness thoughts)
Alone

    





Hear Me

Clearer than a whippoorwill
Quieter than an ivory key
More subtle than the raindrops still
Than the rustling fingers of the leaves

As an echo off a distant peak
As close as fireflies unique
And wide as the array of canvas oils
Which their stretch their colors etched beneath

Spill out by these aesthetic stills
By the gentling ripple of the wandering streams

Call out for where you can hear yourself 
For there you will also find this me

    





Hear my voice when you read me

Hear my voice when you read me
For when I write you I see words
And in knowing such, share
Being delivered about a week later
By a parcel service called self aware

I knock at my own door
For more than me
My closely held tiny dancer
I knock knowingly 
Allowing you to listen in and answer

Hear my voice when you read me

    





Heartbeat Haiku

Hear my heartbeat now
With ears pressed to humble chest
Ever calling out

    





Heartbeat Memories

Even from a distance such as this
Memories breathe 
And our heartbeats beat

    





Heartfailures

The human heart is trying
Though it is inevitably 
Foulably
Undoubtedly 
Corruptibly imperfect in nature 
Lying

Though never the less trying

    





Hear The Wind Of The Stopwatches

The greatest gift a timewinder 
Can give is to not give at all
But to let it pass 
And exist in
Due age is
Death

    





Heartrace

A 
      racing 
            heart 
is not all       that I gained
When you said you would,       yes,
      to seeing       me

Not the source, 
            but the desire       of true,       anxiety 
      Your mere value alone       creates 
the most anxious,       me
      To have       ever      been
            The hope       which once
Was just       a plea

    





Heartspring

You don’t understand, perhaps, just quite how high
Your memory and my feelings therein, can still elevate and makes me fly

If you want to see spring in my step, **** the winter 
If you want to see stars in my eyes, would you be 
And if you’d only speaks words one more time to this wordsmith 
There’s at least one true smile which awaits you, I can guarantee

    





He Is

He is the sky beyond the clouds
The heaven and the highest host
The gentle breath in the wandering fields
And the coolest drink of water in the wellspring of my soul
He breathes life into me
Acknowledges me
And makes my scattered pieces whole
My God with steady outstretched arms
Who offers me a hand to hold

    





He Is There

I stroll among the tiny torches
The little flares of yellow light
With the red lights gleaming overhead

Would you climb over me into this good night?

Into the stars amidst the starlight
My feet attached to these sturdy knees 
Atop the earth 

And I, regretting not that I am alive 
But that I cannot reach beyond the sky
With these warming fingers

For though I am a similar light 
Within this world 
My life is as short and sweet
As the dew which seeps through this good night

How I feel no fear initially 
No need to run nor attempt to hide
From the dimly lit trees beneath the moon 

For the torches in the summertime 
Have always guided this heart of mine
Into the arms of the beloved

The one who is without fault
And who is all of the dawn 

For he is everything devoid of fear
He is the opposite
Like the true perception behind time

    





Hello

Hello poems
I'm your penman 
And your ship which has sailed over a thousand times

Hello times
Where are you going?
Lord knows in nowhere you will find 

Hello no one
Hello some
Hello life and underwhelmingness of love

Hello certainty 
Hello un 
And hello to you my most newly begun

    





Hello History

I don't know you
But I want to

What do you say?
And if you won't

Then I'll see you around
As a smile in history

    





Helping Others

After months submerged 
In the same old stale air still with unlife
I breath 
And in the helpful waters of being and choice 
Choose you my lover being 

It is better to do and try in life

    





Her Amber Crown (A Tanka)

By green in water
Blue in eye and mind alike
With gentle shimmer
Gleaming is the ray above
This, your autumn crown alive

    





Her Cool Embrace

The warmth of these walls welcomes me back
It's been awhile since I've been
Alive and well and in this place
When all around me was a buzz
I found myself alone at last 
In a memory's cool and calm embrace
In love I once was with this place and still I am
For she is far more welcoming to me
Than all of the others
Who never cared for anything beyond the smiles upon my passing face
That is why I'll always love this place
For the role she played in my former life
I simply cannot pass her by 
Without returning her cool embrace

    





Here

It’s a quiet town just waiting to be
Infatuated with you

    





Here Beside You

As I lay down here beside you 
I will pull you in tight
And set your head upon my shoulder 
To rest your fears for the night 

And soon we'll venture on a journey 
To somewhere only we know
We'll visit many distant galaxies 
Where no one else goes 

And then I'll tell you that I love you 
Without saying a word
As if my holding you in silence 
Showed my love as a verb 

And yet within this perfect moment 
There is silence between
With only heartbeats in the dark
To prove our souls aren't asleep

So would you speak to me in silence 
Using those lovely eyes
Because I want to share my secrets 
Which I've hidden inside 

And as I hold you I'll be waiting 
Hoping that you have heard
Because true love is beyond feeling
And we do not need words

    





Her Eyes Are Orange Essence

Your essence is simply everywhere 
like the orange hue
mid afternoon in the summer sun

Your glow, your radiance, resonates clear
in the eyes of other twos and ones

I see you here, your rippling there
through everywhere I pass is you

Your family flutters through the air
such loveliness beyond radio waves of hair

Like ember essence, burning fair
you are midnight candles
your radiance is simply everywhere

    





Her Favorite Song

The universe puts her headphones on
And plays her favorite track
The raindrops in the meadow burst
And soak the earth 
And with her feet up on the world
She smiles from ear to ear 
And plays it back

    





Her Hair Color

Raven, earth, sand, sky
A color for every millennia dream
Through trees in rushed winds
Comes a dancing wish
To know is a reasonable wonder of mine
To explain the why
I wish
For someday (soon)

    





Her Hair In Rain

I do not need a flowing river
Or a mane of branches whispering to me in the morning dew
No
I need only the last the sunlit rays of day
The final sight to be seen
And though you say it does not
Being there certainly does make the rain smell more true

    





Her Hauntingly Beautiful Guise

Hauntingly
Like a mist your guise 
Each summer arrives
And suddenly rolls back home, in time
Through my brick laden, star studded
Slightly falling, downward town
Closing in on forward, your mystery chuff 
Peeks and whispers back mere smiles
Miss Downs
And with a rolling, and a winding
Like a circus wheel turn sideling 
Paddling ever through a waving sky of findings
I am here quiet and there sometime searching
Still in the direction of minding
With constant winding down this familiar lane
Of which your own haunting guise is ever hiding
Forever in your whispers, you are
Miss

"I never know if I should miss you or regret missing you"

    





Heritage

The mountains and the valleys, the rivers and streams of my childhood call out to me and tell me to return to them and swim again, down below the underneath.

My father loved the meadows. Loves the wildness and the wilderness and the winters growth which is yet to be seen, in both the deer and the withering trees.

And part of me remembers still. Because part of him will always be me.

    





Her Lead

I swear 
My ears don't just hear
I can see your song in resonance flow
Into the intimate air which we share
When I am here
And the sound of us in being is near

    





Her Life In Charcoal

A splash of color beside the eyes
With ravens lock or barley bright

A starlight freckle on either side below woolly rise
Where pale skin moonlight meets heavy misted

As I scratched away and bent my back 
To curve her own ever so slightly twisted

How I drew my girlfriend on a page
Until she then in dimension existed

    





Her, Most Beautiful, Peppermint Tea

Rest your face in these hands of mine
No grasp or claspe necessary 
As steaming whisps escape your peppermint lips
I realize this
That you aren't even close to a distant memory, no
You are just as clay
A white lipped cup of herbal tea
Intoxicating and soothing
Dulcetly flooding all of these cold November senses in me

    





Her Name In Autumn

I dream an autumn dream of you
In a winter lasting longer than sun
Burning hotter than stars 
In the coldest nights sleep

I dream of an autumn us there too
So much so and so often now
That there's not a rain cloud left in the sky
For me to express myself 

I dream and dream 
Alive
Awaiting the autumn skies
Return

    





Her Outline

She’s always walking away
And at a pace that’s too fast for me
And even though I walk alone
And rather quickly 
She is always walking steadily 
Away from me

    





Her, Reading On A Hillside

With hair falling before quiet ears
And mind bent steadily on pages of ink
Resting softly above the earth
Her chest rises and falls
In steady unison
Her pulse patters faintly like little feet
And with quiet eyes, she looks up suddenly at me
And winks

    





Hers Was The Best Raspberry Mocha On Earth

Like a purple gem
Found deep within the Earths dark layers
Smooth as sandstone beneath rivers running
Warm as blackened pavement beneath summers sun

So this drink is to me
Most teasing of every sense and self
Which is why this cup cannot be
Most tasteful or worth

She made for me
The Best Raspberry Mocha On Earth

    





Her Wet Hair

One memory
Would endure everything
Always coming back like the bounding footprints left beneath each drop of rain
And that is
The smell of her hair in the morning air
The stringiness and collective song 
The shortness of breath 
The vibrance of wave
And all at the length of a violin's strings born long
Torn is such a memory of song
Between fondness and regret

    





Her Words Like Dew Still Cling To Me

The trees knew more
And long before the morning dew
Of what we were 
And when would end
This indescribable 
Thee

    





Hesitation, A Haiku

Hesitant to move
Or in part become fulfilled 
Lest I be caught still

    





He Was An Alcoholic

I bought him a drink
But not that kind
Unable to grant answers in any amount
All I could offer him was this
The most basic human commodity
And I did
I offered him time

    





Hi!

With a song in my ears
And a smile on my face
This is the small window of change
For me
Where I can be charming and unafraid 
Truly comfortable
In this informal space alive

Hi!

    





Hidden

Nestled
Within the crackle of a fire 

Whispered 
In the voices of the wind

Resting 
Just beyond the nights first desire 

Dawning
With the rivers running

THIS is THE PLACE where we begin

    





Higher

As liquor should be locked up
Too strong is it
A drink for all

So also should these chambers be
Refined behind iron
Pad and key

Not opening to doors like worlds
But renewed in truth 
Baptized in study
And blessed by the best footprints in all

No educated mind can bare
The suffering of one
Let alone the many within these empty halls

    





highstrungyoungman

His tune returns — Anew and ever strong 
(like telephone wires in the wind)                                               
Not infallible —but swaying still                         
With a lyrical cadence there 
(he is ready to begin)

    





Highway Beside

Cars roll by in subsequent order
Aimless yet guided
Aware of me yet not
And so, gone in an instant
Though similar in nature
Are thoughts 
Are cars
Are these other lives
Are these

    





Highway Flowers

One more day
One more breath 
One more second yet to pass by me
In exhaling exuberance of life and living fast 
I am tired of seeing 
And by roadsides existing 
Not stopping to smell thoroughly 
Such quiet flowers by the wayside 
Passing myself by 
This is me

    





Hilltop Meadow

Thoughts which echo
Like the sounds of Ray LaMontagne
Through the somehow and the same 
Bounce back and off these northern stars 
And slowly fall
Down beneath our feet, this hilly plain

    





Hinted Sounds

Eternal time
Is hinted at, implied
For a moment within this solumn sound
But that is not for us to know
As humans with, within this truth
Surrounded by and all around

    





His Favorite Sight

The night sky lays out on its trampoline bed
With all it's stars and nebula friends
Looking down into eyes 
Streaming looks pouring out
In admiration it is thus 
How the night sky wishes upon us 
That it had such strong feelings felt

The sky envies my friends 
It told me so

    





His Forearms

I see the way
My father’s arms
Are wearing out
And breaking down
Underneath this daily weight
And I am afraid
Of my own day
Which is yet to come
But will not stay away

    





His &amp; Her Tankas

Radiant dawn born
Like the morning dew dripping
Off of the treetops
And the planted hopes within
That he won't be lonely when

Radiant dusk dies
Like the aged life left alive
After grass clippings
Fall outside the window still
For one final time, he cries

    





His Hollow Chest

The hollow sound of heavy rain
As it beats upon an empty chest
No leaves to tear or lives to end
There is only rain 
And storms unrest

    





His london fog

If the London air tasted anything like this
I'd pray for wings and spout quick as can be

And fly to another continent so fast
It would make your head spin

If only tea were in the air
As in flavor pallet here it is with me

    





His Night, Her Day

Darker than the shade beneath the heavy trees on a moonless night
So my heart has been when my companion is thee
For we are more different than the sun and the stars
Than the earth and mars 
Never to be crossed but ever cross at the universe 
For placing us this far apart
You throw me underneath the evergreens 
Like the very shade of which you sing
Dark as the midnight hour and cold as the dawn of each new morn
Where not a glimmer of hope has a chance to stay 
This is why we both must find another way 
To tear ourselves apart from the sky 
And to rotate the distance and turn away
Hence why the sunlight and the shade are not the same
For they are the inverse and the opposite
As you and I are night and day

    





His Northern Heart

If the blindingly cold winters of the north, could say just one thing to her in part. 
It would be that she, a southern belle, knew not of the warmth of this gentleman's heart.

    





His Words &gt; Mine

After so many words have passed my lips 
After being so warm 
Like fire on the edge of my fingertips 

I amazed by what I find 
Both within me and within this
My seemingly same old somber mind 

Because all of a sudden
The same old feelings
And the same old wooden stirring stick 
Have broken into a dozen pieces 
And suddenly I am settling in 
After weeks of feeling uncommonly mixed 

This is a different side of me and yet the same 
With a broken stick cast at my feet 

How I want to share 
Because it reminds me 
Exactly how I would like to be
But to be like this forever and always 
To be locked in this form exclusively 
Would be nothing short of torturous for me 

So I’ll search for new words with this month
And try and find a way to stretch 
The same old somber sayings which 
Always seem to bunch up in my mind 

So I’ll search along the wall of time
From here until the very end
Until I find the truth within
Where his words begin
And my words end

For only his words are perfect and kind 
And enough to restore my peace of mind

    





Hitting It Out

Square me up with a new a vengeance
  Strike thunder of a different kind
    Pray not to see my gleaming face when you're ahead
      But hear me first 
        Boom loud with anticipation
          When you're behind

    





Holding For You

Emptiness
Is having held once before
And having time alone
Say no more 

Holding For You

    





Holding Hands With No One At The Train Station

Let my hands know, not stray 
My mind not walk into the sunlight bright 

With a will of being, I persist 
And by all means, mean
When approaching this 

Still reserved, stirred and steady 
Waiting patiently as the moon
Full as tides, light as snow 
Closer than a ticking soon

Approach 
My time it will be, ours  
Just as the train will come, I will be ready

    





Holding Them All Perfectly

Writing is catching every firefly in the meadow, and holding them all perfectly without holding any at all.

    





Holding Your Every Breathing Breath

When you first meet someone
And they meet you
Looking to see all within
A vacuum is created
Your first touch a new universe found
With colorful smoke inhaled, contained
And your newfound faith and willingness to be
Exceeds anything felt before that first breath shared
Before and after 
We and me

    





Holes In The Clouds

Pointed hopes 
Peirce skies above 
And in colorful fallings 
Reach the pinnacle of scope 

We are seen most only when we glow

    





Holiday Coffee

All my favorite 
Coffee shops 
Closed at noon 
The only problem 
Is that I 
Only open up 
Soon after that

Holiday Coffee crew

    





Homeliness and Homelessness

You dust the cobwebs
Dawn the attic 
Wear the house like a flared dress 
So that I can see the not so bitter end
How our world would end

And I’ll pull the nails of our old lives out
One by one until all around  
Fall the remnants of these former towns 

Building homes amidst adventures is not how

    





Homes Are Never Alone

Even houses have their own natural homes
The quite corners adjacent to trees
Where their plots were mean to be

    





Honda Girl (HGS)

To the cutest girl 
   Amongst all the lunks

Purple, white and black as the sky
   (As you know)

Hard work and a trusty Honda
   Such things will get you anywhere in life
   Be it an outcome which requires this
   Such slender *****

Enjoy your night!

    





Honest

When I jump 
And finally leave behind 
This old Earth's atmospheric mind
It will not be to orbit any one or thing
No 
Instead when I leave it all behind
It will be for the clearest of visions
Well communicated in kind
It will be for the truest tidal wave of being
That I leave my only I behind

    





Honesty and Fairness

I cast no stone but the honest truth. 
That hypocrisy runs in all of our veins. 
Around the inner workings of man. 
Yet its our own perception of things which pollutes the mission, the vision, the application. 
Blacken my eye and ****** my nose. 
What will I do? 
What can I do?
When I'm not a stone am I with you?

    





Honey, A Tanka

Somedays my own
Headphones more than blue eyes
Want to sit you down
Turn on the song which turns me
And spin our eternity 

(I want you, honey)

    





Hooked On You

Bricks cry your shy name
With tearlessly hopeful eyes
Ceiling tiles wooden floors
How they hang unpon your every word
Hooked are they 
On the frame of this room
And on you as am I

    





hopefully forever

I hope so now, more than ever, forever
That you will see my face in the quiet uninhabited corners 
And when you hear this song
May you always
Remember

    





hoping for an endless night

Sometimes I ... want to keep you, still. to stop the earth from breathing, the seas from braking, and its foam from reaching his conscious shores. sometimes aligned the night wishes, upon us, itself not to end. and the dawn away from us. because love is love, and heaven is held, here as far away from your thoughts as hell. sometimes I find ... that I just want more, and more of us as well.

    





Hovering In The Sky

Miranda 
I will tarry here
For a little while left in hope 
Until honesty grips me by the shoulder blades
And bades me back
To walk the lengthy line alone
For a little bit longer
For a while, I go

In the sky, a star hovers, while another passes by

    





How A Heartbeat Rings In Ears

The unheard sound 
Like a song stretched out
Over the many sunrises spent
Beneath silken vine and canopy tent 
Forever is a very long time left to see
But this sound still unenduring 
Is the most beautiful thing 
To be heard of and by me

    





How Expectations Grow (IN Love)

Wood takes years to sink
As sap turns slow to stone over time
Unknown highs 
The kind which are not easier seen
But are known to the sky as common sights
Be it high or low expectations abound 

It is harder still than all of these trees
More fermented than
To love someone for who they are
And not what you think of them
Or what you expect them to do
(For someone else the likes you)

    





How Feelings Pass

Some days my heart feels heavy with it
The distant want
 The growing fear 

The way it is but will not stay 
For the remainder of these
More youthful days 

My heart is this
Alone 
But not at last 

Instead how it wanders 
Through fields of idealism
And lets you pass

With every conscious moment 
In this 
How I dream of you and let you pass

    





How Friends Appear

If life is sleep
Then best friends walk into being
Like a glorious dawn
And in your own confusion, you never see
Where they came from or what you did
To deserve to walk alongside
Such a kindred being

You never knew, and you never will

It just is

    





How I Feel

Somedays I hate the way my own body heat, collects and is in entrapped within. In the arms of wind I nowtimes wish, that I could relax again and just for a moment be. Truly, cool and light, airy and free.

    





How I Feel This Morning

Standing on my windowsill
Your breakfast blend the only name on my lips
How I wash my exponential coffee cup
With cold rain water
Just to splash me down
As it falls to the ground
Rolling off that fated roof, and feeling amiss
For that is that, and this is this

    





How I Miss Her

On days like this, I wish she were here. I wish she was already asleep in my bed. 

I wish that my sheets smelled more like her hair, and less like the mess that I left there instead. 

How I wish, and I wish, like the stars she'd appear, every night, before my eyes, burning crystalline clear. 

How I wish and I wish for our future my dear, for a setting in which we would ever draw near. 

Yet alone every night only my voice I hear. As I question myself, have I've become what I feared?

Until dusk meets the dawn, wisper words in my ear. Say I miss you my darling, say I miss you my dear.

    





How Intuitives Write

I do not worship nothing
Because it's the opposite of something
Instead I find only slight praise in those moments
When a quiet something new emerges
From what I perceive to be
But probably isn't
Nothing at all

    





How I Operate

When I work I work
What I say I say
What I do I do
And unlike you
When I must work
I work ahead at what I said I would do

    





How I See You Seeing Me

In seeing this, like warming soup 
your look alone brings a boil to my simmer 
a slyness to my smiling scarf 

And in just a second there I am
brought back to the height 
of the days born youth known as soon

And when I walk in tall, and styled, and true
in that moment, yes, I see
that the walking is both for me and you

It's both - For me and you

    





How I Tend To Write

Declarative me, saying what I was
With a question inbetween

Feeling better as if I'd breathed again
In the quiet stillness of unthinking

In such words I lose myself for a min
Until hours catch up and overtake me

As if questioning what I was and then
Sets me free to begin and be

This is how I tend to write and then
This is why, it's is not, and for me

    





How It Feels

You can lay out the road before them
Paint skies 
Crush nights rock into glasses
Grow forests in days of young
And refuse to drink the seas before their very eyes
You can do all this 
(in a few days)
But only they can decide to walk

    





How It Feels To Be An Introvert

I love the silence
I love the echo
The hum of distant motor cars
The shadow off of mountain fog
Which flows down to valleys down below

I love the quiet feeling felt
The warmth of soul most well be known 
Like water from a faucet warm
I rub my hands in anticipation 
Of being left in the quiet alone

    





How It Feels To Hit A Homerun

I feel both God and man alive
Death and valleys
Lows and mountains cresting high into the sky 
A mere extension of this mortal coil 
An unwinding of the intensive human mind
Combusts on thirty three inches of imperfect maple 
And explodes like thunder into joyous cries 
And for a moment I am king of the dust 
For about three hundred and sixty feet of it, I am alive 

(I swear that last one is still going)

    





How I View The World

Close your eyes to show you
The slant of the earth
Gradual and complex 
The tilt of the head 
Simplistic and free
Therein found rounded edge
The view from the corner seat besotted 
See that?
I wish the world could see the world like me
Just this once

    





How I wrote last Sunday

Today I sat down
Like an ocean full
And grabbed a pen to crash waves
Onto the shoreline of thought

Having done so - I'm free
Having done so -- I'm me

    





Howler

A dog grins
Knowing he was once a wolf
And one day he will be again

    





Howling At Last Nights End

Howling on the inside
Moon above alive
Tonight in luminescent essence 
Amongst the ever ending happiness 
The will to be there for 
And therein search of her
Tonight
I do not have a lover
But if I did I'd be missing her

    





How Love Feels At Thirty

Does a snowfall wait for a summers embrace?
No.
Do they ever meet?
Also no, sadly.

    





How She Arrived

The daughter of the moon and I
Fell from the stars
And crashed into a lonely lake
Where she would spend all of her days
Forsaking all others
Except for this
The wielder of the sword to be
To rule the world
By his own outstretched hand

    





How she wears clothes

Were I to be 
Even an inconstant breeze
In the sails of your chest
Occasionally 
I would never be lacking 
In joy or breath
Or in breathing or sense
I would never be without 
Or separated from want of
This breathy desire

The way you wear clothes is killing me slow

    





How Tall You Are

Never forget
Though you will
That you are a <strong>mountain</strong>
Formed by two forces 
Meant to last
Slowly moving
Clearly never
*BUT NEVER STILL

    





How the dusk ignites the night

Uniqueness
Oneness
Fullness soon

Is lost
Alone
Yet here with you 

With memories
Skies
Call out
In all

Like birds
Begin
To fly 
And then

With a sudden 
Swift
And motion of night

It falls 
And falls
To its own ignite

    





How The Sunlight Curls

Green
  Growing
   Not like the heart</em>
Red with eternity
  Ever slowing</em>
Dying slowly 
   Like the sun
  Is the knowingness 
    Of the dead leaves</em>
Be near to me
  Be evergreen</em>
Growing
 *Knowing
   Thinking of these

    





How The Tide

The ocean
Crashing rolling in the deep
Turning stones slowly felt to sand
Beneath the feet, and yet

No one can tame the tidal crash
Where the waterways collapse and meet

Though many have tried
How the waves of time wash over us all
In the shallow end of this single life

Because regardless of fear, or the deep
So the morning tide will ever subside
And yet never live to see the setting sun

Just as the castles of our yesterday will be swept away
By the water pulling at our feet 

So the ocean will always crash and roll
With a gentleness and honest swell
Resting calmly in-between 
Each wave

    





How They Shine

You speak of stars 
As if on first name
No closer you are to me

Yet I am in my own atmosphere
Just waiting to breathe
And fill my lungs with thee

Forget, no don't 
The memory in mind
Of when tingling spines aligned

No starlight impedes 
Be it out of reach
How your words once made me shine

    





How Thoughts Skip and Sink

All I really do is stumble and walk 
Kicking stones, picking rocks, skipping thoughts

    





How Time Feels This Spring

This time is not wasted
Though poorly spent

On the repetitious tasks know mostly to me
And to all those wishes and crashing dreams
Which fall down from star height
And burn into a nine to five atmosphere

Tell myself it's not wasted
Loaned and lent

Tell myself it was meant
To be spent

    





How To

Love her like your ideal love
Like the dream of how she’ll love you
But an ideal is not an excuse for this
You must explain what love means to you

    





How To Become A Great Poet

You 
Decide to start and never stop
And years later 
When the memories of life pile up around you 
Like the books beside a crowded shelf
You learn to be content with where you are
As compared to where you could be
Because fame is not to be desired
No, fame is to be pitied
Because you didn’t start for fame
And you didn’t continue for fame
And if you did you are a fool for fame
Because you became what you became
Because you already were
You

    





How To Find Poems

The best verses are not torn from the heart
Or ripped from the head
But are pulled from your mouth, endlessly, like a piece of string
Flowing from between your lips 
Until all that needs to be said and done
Is out there, in the world
And it exists

    





How to find yourself

Ask not
How can I not be (today)
Ask what instead you need to create
Before it's too late (in this dying day)

    





How To Focus

See the eye of a flying dragonfly, hovering as you back away 
Dry your feet on the side of the bank and wait
As you look up past the trees to see, if the breeze was visible that day
Find a cloud in the sky that is not too high and then brush it all away

    





How To Hear Life

Don't let the loudest voice be only 
A demanding cause 
Or you'll walk to falter instead 

But balance all harshness with evenness and grace 

Incarnate, the limits you put on yourself 
Are all just you 
Are all just injustices in your head

    





How To Live Life

For whatever it is 
You feel called to do
You choose what it is 
But remember this
First consult your form of truth 
And then do it for them
As do it for you

    





How To Relax

No matter what your battle is
What your sin or cost to be
I see, in this now
That it doesn't get easier for you, yourself
Until you
Let yourself, let it. Be.

    





How To Strike

So many poets attack with words, 
With the intent to hit you on the first line. 
Like a clunky sword or strand of steel, 
Which couldn't so much as break through twine. 

To which I would say, 
That you must first name and know yourself, 
Or at least your opponent, 
Before you try and sway or slay them with a single line. 

Such poetry would mean to me, 
Little more than a stick, 
In a sword fight with a gigantic tree. 

Try not to aim for the heart immediately,
But approach the chest, 
And hum your bladed words through the air most rhythmically. 
Until an opening you do see for such an acute verse as me. 

Deliver then a heavy blow,
A fatal strike. 
Which will leave the readers lying in the streets, 
Bleeding out of relief and not out of agony and disbelief.

    





How Words Appear

I was walking
Down a path of premeditated evergreen
Kicking at pinecones with a well-known song
When you came along
And in looking down at this discovery
Not that you fell too far for me
But there you were
Most beautiful and suddenly
There and aware
You became known to me

    





How Writing (Told) Goes

Give me nothing 
 But time
Everything within

  This wanting to be of something 
    And there will be neither writing
 Nor ending 

   For a summer storm 

 But combined 

      And in giving me a required aim
  When there is sound to be found

 And creation to pro 

  Then the writing will flow
As if out of a struck desert stone
      And swell

    





Huemen

Unfeeling is no cloud above
Though ground unwilling to hold you fast
Like stars and fires and ocean sands
We turn and burn and age unto ash 

Huemen

    





Human Fixitie

If you're reading me
In this moment now
We are one and the same
Not just in eyes or in fixitie of mind
But by the air we breathe 
With the dreams we dream
In mutuality of meaning
We are alive

    





Humanity &amp; Faith

Different isn't an alter to bow 
Nor change a prayer 
Or a party anything less than a high

No all of THIS, that is human, is only being 

Our faith is living
And in living it out
A M P L I F I E D 

I recommend you go higher, friend

    





Humanity, Inevitability

No amount of organization 
Or busyness 
Or peace of mind 
Can keep you from it

The realizations 
Of these
Of this
Of time

Endless and dripping 
Reaching from an eternity of ripples 
Beneath lakeside pines 

Just as no amount of distraction
Can keep you from within 
From your own mind

    





Humans and being

We are all human
We all are being
All self doubt and smoke and ashes and dust
We settle still
And stirr like stones
And never stop the search for meaning
We all are human
We are all being

    





Human Struggles

No woman's hand will warm my own
And I need no other voice to tell me I can

I'll find no confort in the confusion of another person's soul
I have enough problems within my own

I feel no obligation to try and break this human mold
For this is simply how I am

I just wish that I could stop expecting others
To somehow create the value in me
Which would permit me to grow old without regrets

This most definitely it's a terrible venture in which to invest

    





Hunger

I keep telling myself what I know to be true. 
That I will not be here forever and ever. 
And that one day I will be all which I endeavor to do. 

You see, little old me never applied to me. 
Because I am young and I am tall. 

The world which I've yet to know stretches out before me. 
And yet all I want to do is find the inner peace which sets me free. 
The kind of peace which allows me to travel and return again without wanting to flee. 

I have found such peace to a certain degree, but it's not enough. 
My appetite is unsatisfied by this snack of life, and I doubt myself. 
That I could possibly organize and properly depict the entirety of this thing called self. 

Who am I kidding?

I'm just a man who keeps telling himself. 
And that is the trick, to making the words in my stomach stick. 
Like wild rice, are my thoughts to me. 
But to find their way into the dish of life, will this not satisfy the appetite in me? 

No. Because no hollow words from this hungry man will appease, the hunger for perfection in me.

    





IALR

Like rain
I fall, I rest and evaporate 
Over and over again
One and the same
I am like rain

    





I Always Forget, Always

To the side 
With mindful eyes, lax 
Like the smile which always wide 
Comes back 

Sitting beneath the old mailbox by the railroad tracks</em>

Trying so hard not to forget 
The words inscribed
Which you promised me
In the letter that never came

    





I Am Not, Though I Feel

In my weakness 
He is strong
Far mightier than oak and stone 

And though I do not understand myself
He does 
And for some reason knows

About about all of the things I do to distract
Just to keep myself
From the sinfulness in these decaying bones 

And so I wait for this feeling to pass
Though I know the truth
I am not, though I feel, alone

Because in that moment
When no human hand can steady you
Where then my friend, are you going to go?

As for me, I know that I will go back
To the one true God 
Who existed long before this earth was home

    





I am the opposite of your existence (breathe)

My carbon becoming 
near this oxygenated girl
Breathe 
breathe 
breathe 
and breathe
Everything but me, IN
as my outward going is

    





Iamtired

I know no pain
No ache or throb
Quite like the morning after life
The day after the perfect night 
Which has gone into the bitter dawn

No walking coffee can salvage me
From such a feeling 
Such a wrong 

I am
Tired

    





I Can't Explain, Just Put On My Headphones

Hush is not a shush, lover
Change is not of force but nature
Grown from stem, and root, and sound
Like fingerlings in the mountain streams
Like the tingling of your neck rundown 
Can you hear the ripple deep the vein?
Can you feel the starlight warm composed?
Will you look in my eyes and see
Yours of the possibilities found
The kind of wish we both know?
With this symphonic symbol yours
And the seconds fleeting faster than stars
Falling I give you more than another song
Which I do not own
With this I, I give you my own

    





Identical

I see your doppelganger here 
I’m always most polite to her
Because I know
Because I see
Just who she it 
Just who you were

    





Identity In Eyes

Quietly justifying 
The existence of the other
The lines of his jaw
The turn of her hair
But not in hand
For its beneath the surface
Of the conscious mind
That the search began
And there it will end
There it will end

    





I Dream Of You, And Then?

A dream of you is like a story 
I cannot, will not, wait again
To catchup and
Turn a sheet, a page 

Dive and then, upon awakening 
Will myself 
Be whisked away again
Just to see you 
And if, what then?

Sadly
No future is found in an ounce of sleep

    





If Death Were Good

How could people die, I'd ask
In the springtime of youth 
Most ignorant, find

Now I know, why people die at last 
When the aches and the pains 
Persuade, the mind 

For they pass
And pass
As all do in time

And the new want of me 
Is mine 
This time

Because now, there is no one
Who remembers my ask 
Noone outlives the time

    





If Feelings Were Rain

Say not
That I let my emotions seep
Like a sidewalk stream
Down a sewergrate
No 
Instead let it be said
That whatever I felt
Evaporated clearly under the sun
To return to that cloudy head of mine
Up in the sky

    





If I Knew Before I Knew

Stay your tongue to save discomfort 
Stay your tongue and lose forever
The chance to speak of whatever it was 
No forever lasts forever  

(4LINE)

    





If I Were

If I up and died today
Would anyone know?
About the archives stored away?
About the words which I've locked away?
And if I died on such a day
Would anyone ever find a way
To link me back to those former days?
To hear the words I once did say?
If I were to die this present day
Would you find me here along your way?

    





If looks were caffinated cares

Felt as felt 
Between two warming ears 
And snow, the kind of snow, which disappears 
Into pools of eyes so blue and crystalline 

You are somewhere between ***, and coffee, and jazz, and caffinated cares, and mystery

And I cannot help but see

    





If Love Is Like Water

They are dying for it, they are bleeding for it, they are begging for it. And yet it will not come. 

Like pure water from a well of mud, I dig for those who cannot drink, and wait with those who thirst on their own. 

I am disgusted by those who flaunt it. By those who pour their wasted water out and splash it down upon the stones. 

So cold and careless. They care nothing for the crowded rooms, filled with those who stand alone.

    





if verses were oceans, and the sea her keeper

spin me like an old record fine
with a crackling sea 
in an endless summers day to see

and hear what you will 
I, between these vinal keys
humming brightly refined 

wherever memories may be 
there also you will find 
the shores on which our oceans first met

this 
continual 
collide

    





If With Me

I’d place this song between your ears
Your fingers in-between my own
I’d turn this world of our inside-out
And Upside-down
Just to find you a place that you'd call home

    





If Words Could Speak

Catch me
Like a Firefly in a glass tomb
Like a candlelit flame in a dark room

I am narrative alive and well
Time reincarnate
And I give myself most humbly forward

Charred and broken at both ends
Until my own ashes turn lie and truth
I burn on every living tongue for you

    





If you

If you give a man ... more stones to dig
He'll find
If you give a man ... more time
He may still not know, let alone who
If you take from him ... nothing when you go
Then the building of his own high wall, is no crime of yours
Ever, nor ever was

    





Ignoring

Still cups
Quiet unspokens
The hierarchy of all those who swim

What does it mean?

That you can take my silent ignorance as a token
That you are capable
And I am unwilling

    





I have always wished when I see her

Seeing is not see
When
You pass me by and in wonderings if
We the other, remember each
As clearly as a birthday bright
As cool externally as moonless nights
I say
No more to try and persuade 
My cause to alter that of your own mind
Instead I sip
Juat as you know I wish
For more than this 

Because, I cannot help it
My subconscious is attracted to your subconscious 

And that is why I wish

    





Illusion

No matter how many doors or windows or walls or structures may stand to fall, on the growing wasteland of this Earth. 

It's refreshing to know that it all will end, and that with that end, there is no real difference between the unearthed and earthed.

There is only the idea of time beneath it all.

    





Illusive

Holding onto you
And your thoughts
Is like water dripping
Through me and my hands

    





I'm Convinced

I'm Convinced
That after the last fence post ends
Just over the edge

That around the corner beyond the meadow
Is the end

And beyond that
Is rain

Endless and resting
Forever to be parted from the sky

Until the new life comes
And I am refreshed

It is then
And within

Would you explore with me?
Until our own end?

    





I'm Just Calling To Say, I Love You

The only voice I wish to hear
Like the padding of the deer
And the misty Falls approach in trees
Which whispers here, and
With wandering footprints, there

Like the only sky I've ever been
Before being rush back within
To an eternal indoors
Full of plastic stars which burn out slow
And the hum of air which,
Once conditioned, streams

It's such a beautiful sound, I see
Such a lovely thought, that now I feel
You, my flooded mind, in ears
Begs this of my most unsubtle me
Let me drown anew
In this memory, please

    





Immortal

First, our bones and then our homes, with fences soon to follow. 
Every stone built wall to turn back to the earth. 
Like a grave left open every winter, burying itself within the snow.
No child is left to grow into youth when the world turns back into its own. 
A collapse isn't always an inward thing. 
Just as the inhabitants aren't always meant to inherent what their parents owned. 
No life or existence is completely secure.

    





Immortal Arms

God
Please hold her
As only you can 

Would you curl her up
In the palm of your hand?
And be with her
When I cannot?

Would you attend to her most every need
With efficiency 
And make her well when she is not? 

Because you know how she is
How she has these beautiful wandering dreams
And occasionally such restless thoughts

Would you speak to her now
With an voice unseen?
And reassure her that you are indeed the king
The creator of time and everything 

Would you curl her up
And keep her more closely 
Than ever she would've been to me?

Will you do this for me, my dear Lord?
Have you heard my prayerful repetitious plea? 

If so I will stop until tomorrow 
And finally try and get some sleep

Would you comfort her with immortal arms?
From a prayerful, tired version of me

    





Immortal Feelings

In a world full of arrogance and immortal feeling
It's so easy to forget how very mortal we are

    





Immortal Flame

The desire to be a creator never burns out
Like the immortal flame that it is
 It may waiver, it my wane in the blowing wind 
But it never dies, completely becomes extinguished or unhinged  
Just so long as you keep it calm and still 
And close to your true heart within 

Because the essence of desire is the creation which will linger in a state of wonderment
Wishing only that the original thought could be
 All which you could've hoped and dreamed
About and for*

Mesmerizing isn't it? 
The flame unseen

    





Impermanence

By the time you get
What you so badly wanted
Within this world
Within this life 

You probably won't want it anymore</em>

That is a consequence of life
Of the long hallway
And the time that it takes
For you to commit
To walking through that distant door

Whatever it is

By the time you get to that fame or fortune 

*You might not even want it anymore

    





Impressive Savior

I pray my pen
Flows not with think 
But with spirit embodied 
As there is more to impress
In the ink of Christ 
Than there ever was or will be
In this expression of me

    





I'm Sorry (4LINE)

No mountain range is worth the hike with you by side 
Nor seat stays warm in conversive pace 
Though it’s sad to see wasted such a pretty sunrise 
Your particular light is not to my eyesight a pleasant taste

    





I'm Through With Crashing Love

Floating within turmoil
Hovering above 
Crashing no more amongst the shores of love
I see the wave and fly 
Higher unto high

    





Im Tired of Everyone But You

My world is words
My pen my ears

And all I want right now
Is to hear

You
And you alone

All other noisey words can go
Back into their never homes 

Alone

Indulge me please

    





Inadequate Search

Someday, they'll burry my grave, long after the ink and parchment have faded.

Long after my thoughts have longsince passed into the undying lands.

I just hope that my neices don't have to burry me

Which is why now I search for a new family.

    





In A Flooded Field of Cattails

A walking wisp took my hand
The other lifetime for a spell 
And in leading us to a flooded field of homeless tails 
And endless tells 

Outback with water through my shoes
I with-saturated-held 
Onto her with everything I had
Yet forward I still fell

Into a flooded field of endless tales

    





In A Heartbeat

I'll trade you

The warm breath of this night in June
To be replaced by the warming breath of you
Just below your fine and fearsome eyes
In such a heartbeat I could be satisfied
Instantly

I'll trade you

    





In A Rainstorm

As close as the rain which runs down the veiny leaves of the poplar trees. Closer still to you and to your thoughts do I wish to be.

    





In A Straw Field

Straw hemmed down
Crackling beneath collapsed feet
And folded underneath
Like a prayer 
I'm bound to you and to this moment
Like a song 
I wait for the inevitable record scratch
And the crackling repeat
Of whenever we roll
Over the breaking backs of the strawfall down
On the bed we made
Where our young bodies first did meet

    





In A World At Peace

Familiar as clock chimes from younger days 
The reinforcement of fact, and that
No matter how little my ability to stay, may be
When the time is right
And the world at peaceful lingering, I
Is where we will find and stay 
Remaining in a gentle, outlined memory

    





Incapable Capable

Where capable love - becomes compelled to try
And turns into "he acts" 
Even when she is "intent on inaction"

There is no-one so capable - this nothing more senseless
Than the song upon deaf ears 
Which falls in a beautiful hum, regardless 

Because you made up your mind about me long time ago

    





Incredibly Tiring Distractions

Having children of my own, somewhere, someday...
Will be to me, the most phenomenal distraction from self which could ever be...

    





Indescribable Sight

And in asking of self, most honestly, said
“Are you afraid, once you’ve spoken the words, that you’ll truly be free?
That you’ll fall off the earth without purpose or being
Just because you’ve finally shared, what for so long you yourself could not see?“ 
I am afraid of this? 
Perhaps, maybe

    





Indicators

Indicators of the night sky, bursting bright. 
The kind of bugs which glow so brightly it must surely hurt their buggy eyes. 
In the summertime they come alive, to illuminate the dark of night. 
And slowly wake by no mistake, to congregate and enjoy their lives. 
Because they are the fireflies and it's with the summer they coincide. 
Like a lightning storm or an electric hive, they soar as more than just common flies. 
Perhaps the owl of old was right when he said that you wouldn't believe your eyes, 
At the ten of millions of indicators, burning across the open sky.

    





Indivisible Clouds

Did you know that when it rains
It secretly rains on us all? 
Buildings or not 
No state or county line alive
Can divide those underneath from which it falls
The glorious sky
The bellowing sky
Which opens up its eyes every morning 
Just to look and see that we are yet still alive 
And even though that same old sky 
Which connects us though cannot love 
It’s only because of such blessings from above
That we can learn to live and love at all

    





In dreams I can finally hear

I dream 
Of the shadows we would cast 
And in moonlight drape ourselves
And make
The flowers we'd align with rain
As we celebrate 
The no more of snow
And the frozen pond on which we'd skate
For no less than an eternal day
Like sunlight to hold
Close until we have our own
End of night alight
Sleeping in each others confidence 
Without even being awake
And I 
Cannot, will not, wait 
At least to dream 
Of these such things
And in other words make dreams 
Of another heighted sky alive

    





In Due Time

Who I am
And if I'm good enough
True enough to be
Should not be my concern
Because when someone wants to see you
They generally see

In due time
All is seen

    





I Need This Song

Humming by the rivers run 
My feet at a loss for words most forward 
Nothing is left in the wake of everything 
And I’m certainly not bored
But stop
And by the meadow besideme you may see 
Like water or breath
Like droplets of sunlight behind concrete cold 
Or faith and love and homeruns high
I need this time like the trees need the sky 
And in not knowing I
Find that I cannot breathe in this sort of life

    





Inevitability

The best is when the conscious mind
Focuses in on what it knows 
On what it is 
Never once considering what it means
To be that "something" for someone else 

Simply looking around 
Tells me enough about myself 
To know that someone, someday 
Will walk by my shelves in all of their glory 
And smile at the mind in which I've built

    





Inevitability, A Tanka

Don't care for shadows
Just as sunshine cannot keep
And stars must burn out
All in their oceanless end
So we also soon will be 

(Inevitable)

    





Inevitability of Life

The strength I have, will fade.
The moment at present, is past.
The second I win, I’ve lost.
And the instant I live, I'm dying.
That is not to say.
That the moment of hope, is hopeless.
Or that the second you find, you'll be found.
But that there always is truth and the opposite.
And the grace there within to be found.

    





Inevitable Life

No matter how hard I try
How far I hike
No hands can hold back waves
Or ears can hear the true skies voice
Just as no trees stay
And no sun remains the same for more than a single night 
No matter how hard I try and fight
How high I climb or fast I fall to the ground
No inevitable escapes life

    





Inevitable (loop)

Your mind — Full of itself
Your heart — Lying
With all ambition but a distraction
Don't try of you will lose yourself
On such small things
Relying

    





Inevitable Shores

Take another pass
Find no (new) hopes to smash
There is nothing left on these shores of mine 

All that remains to do - is to laugh

    





Inevitable Sun (A Tanka)

Streaming sunlight calls 
New beginnings like a day
With existence old 
And remembered fondly found
The familiar ways return

    





Inevitable Truth

Expectations are dangerous things
Don't stand, lest you fall
Try, or fail to try, lest you become someone
Either way heartbreak comes for us all

    





Infatuated

As if deep in sleep, devoid of dreams. 
It's the simple way you caress the words, which inspires me. 

To write and reach, yet fall short of you.
Though your tongue paints such a vivid scene. 

How could I not try and partake? 
How could I not wish it to be? 

I'd reach my hand through glass for you, 
Just to give you words from within me.

    





Infinite Value

Words are worth
Infinitely more
When they’re etched in your own currency 
(time well spent)

    





InFlunce

Licking the cider off my ice cubes
I'm in love with words
And the sights of you which I've yet to see

    





Ingenue

I dream of a world
Where you hear my words 
Letting me wander until my oceans run dry
And then in your arms up stream hold still
And onto everything grasp 
As if in every river you wanted to dive

    





Ingrid Bergman

Ilsa didn't see the stars
She . was . the . sky
And held the starlight gently in her ever glistening eyes

    





Initial Mistake

If you suspect that you've made a mistake
And it's me
You have
But not at all the mistake you were thinking of
Initially

    





Inklings

Expressions cannot run like ink
    They can only hold fast
To the paper of memory
    And at our feelings . Grasp
For just a moment to pass
   And think though they will not last

    





In Love, So We Were

When conversations grow darker than night skies cold. And the tree leaves on the breeze fail to whisper the truth. What happens then, after Summer, so far away from the Springtime of youth? I don't know, but ergo Autumn. And with this quote end. Just as the rocks below look up to the sky above. Marylan spoke my mind in synonym that day, and so I'm through with love.

    





In Love With An Ideal

In mind a young mans fortune told
His sky colored and emboldened by light

Though the story is winding like a forest old
Falling into complexity at every summers end

It's in discovery And time
Which you are found 

Lest I find
That I loved not you but this image of mine

    





In Love With Nature, She

Beautiful shade falls freely from these trees beneath this autumn day. Cascades like hope while padding like rain. With puddling saturated truthful rays, it streams like rivers and reflects on kings. With a whistling harp over hills unseen. And this, all this, is your favorite thing. Moreso than me to be underneath. Perhaps, its understandably so. Such fair and free beings in the shade of these most loving trees, I see. Finally see. I am you. And one with you are me.

    





In Memoriam - American Politics

As a support of one such political property 
Of a soul who seems to be so happily
Bartered off and begged and sold
On the corner of progress
Like prime the rib real estate 
(Which ***** is) 

I fear no more for my self or my morals
But for my mind I fear ardently
That this IT will unravel and unwind
If ever again I look at either side and see
Anything less that a creaply constructed property
(Sold off seemingly without want or kind)

    





In My Head Of Hearts

Moonlit lips I often kiss 
Too run around with sunlight 
.........
Stare longingly at rainfall out 
At leaves Fall down
..................
The ocean and her daughter longing 
Calling me to avail myself to their dreams of being
...........................
When really, too often there I am found out 
Too often called by name
....................................
Because I love the same familiar sounds 
Of natures romp abound
...........................
Hence why the beat of a familiar breeze 
In my head of hearts, always pounds
 ..................
Quiet and 
Consistently there
.........

    





Inner Child, Gloating While Playing N64

Every morning when I hide my untie 
Turn on a podcast out the door
And stumble through the cold
In my secretly Italian coat
I leave with coffee
Hot poured with opinions over sleep
And my inner child switches on the N64
Pours hinself some chocolate milk 
And gloats
Holding his eternal freedom over me

    





In Perfect Unison, A Swing

I am balance
Aimed precision 
A conscious living vision embodied 
And driven like the snow to fall 
The rain to well and burst through clouds
With inevitable hope
And warmth which you will know
My aim as always this to grow

    





In Relation To Morning

Life was once to me
A slate to chisel 
Frame to feign 
With stars the occasional to see, unfelt
When really 
As an owl
I never knew a sunrise word until I stopped seeing the morning

    





Insatiable

Sometimes my stomach empties
And it feels like I 
Could consume the sky
With a single breath of air

But when I see my peers 
And their success
How quickly I forget
Every win and concurred fear

The hunger is an eternal thing
With an observation to see
But the memory of what ere I've won
Ought to be enough for me

    





Insatiable Me

Put a river before me, dry
   I drink
   An insatiable sea I'll be

Set a star between myself and my sky
   And watch
   And wait
   And see (what I will be)

    





In Sight

Everywhere I go, unseen 
The prevailing narrative being
"I could not speak to he"

Tall and menacing 
Quiet and stern
So well and in his pace, to flee

Looking quietly past the height of me
And quickly away by chance 
But you

In passing with a scrolling spree
I adore when you can read as this
I adore when you see me

    





In Sleeping There Beside

Shorts which curl, and justify just half way up her thigh
Him outlining her, like the moonbright edge of a starless night
They in perfect unison align
In a quiet breeze breathed out between
And know nothing less until their mutual sunlit dawn, arrives

    





Interpretation

Slowly...
Gradually...
Residually...
Daily...

That's what he means when he says that she... "Pulls on his heart like she pulls on the sea."

    





In the arms of cafe

To be had
I don't know where you're at
But this coffee has me

    





In The Arms of Wind (A Gentle Wish)

I wish our waves would crash
Our stars would pass
At a lesser distance, magnets meet

Our shoes to shed beneath our feet
And boots to knock together in the rain

I would wish the sun and moon to cry
And to always be the same
And that time would pass more slowly now
When observing your most youthful frame

Would you hear it as a rustling
As a crashing of waves within echo ears?
Would the sand between our fingers stay
And forever be the same?

You’re my type of breeze
The height of trees
Whispering in the arms of wind

    





In The Corner of My Eyes

Everywhere I go
She’s in the corner of my eyes
Like a fly 
But I don’t mind
I don’t mind

    





In The Mind

Writers block is a state of mind

Pour yourself out 
Fill your cup
And caffeinate

Don't **** 
But live the time

    





In The Mind Of My Night Sky

Forget about you
Not now, nor ever
No star is forever
But your burning is eternal 
In the mind of my night sky

    





In The Mood

When I'm like this 
I can paint on the wind with a feather brush 
And mix the colors fervently 

<strong>Though I do not stain</strong>

I can hold the canvas however I please
And hang it on a lively tree
Just for you to see 

*The way which these creations have made me

    





In The Path

You're either in the path of the demon
Facing down the fear forthcoming 
That or away you're running
And I am done with that
As a being forthcoming 
About who I want 
In this caution  
Of none 
I will
Be

    





In The Sky

Like a crown of red
Six Emeralds in the sky
Rubies really
Burning each with its own pair of eyes

I mention this
Both because it is and will be
And one day someone else will see
Be it not in the same exact way

Which is fine

But thankfully at least they will see
Or so I hope
That is if, they permit me to show

    





Intimacy

Your hands know you
So much better than my own
Have ever known

How do I?
Which way should I go?

    





Intimate Eyes

The captive head
Escaping hair
Uncontrollable 
You are and then
Sleek 
Thin 
So debonair
It's hard to tell where your beauty begins
And my handsomeness ends

    





Into A Screen, Away From The Self

Stare, but don't stop 
You are unlike any living screen
Tune out your mind from the memory of self 
In a mirror that this you will never be seen
Why is it so, that we hate ourselves
So much so that we must look away
And into the nothingness of ironic things
That we spend our time starting at screens away

    





Into Summer

As I plod along at a placid place
I ask myself most often if
My mind will ever approach that place?

If I’ll I ever be able to move along
Down that path
Be it into the summer or out of May?

“Your brightest days are yet to pass!”</em>
Or so they say, with each differing dawn
And yet I am still unsure of such path, nowadays

Be it winding or not
How they stretch out before me, and bend at a distance
Turning just around the cornery edge
To entice my mind to stray away

How I’d often jump from rock to rock
Devoid of fear, in my younger days
How I'd fly through the air without forethought
That is until I became aware of this present day

Though still I must, and will I trust in my ginormous feet
For it is time I value, and the steadiness which is found outside
That is, I'm seemingly less capable of turning off my mind

For I am afraid of not being able to see
And witness all the beauty which is stored away
Within such paths

For its there</em> and within that</em> which I expect to find
This path of mine

As a memory to create down each pasture lane
Must be simply folly and waste
To ponder such things with every day
This is what I see

When the decision stretches out before me
Not far away
Like a field of green

Whereas so many others are thus condemned to a barren wasteland
Simply put
Her lushness is just one of the things
That will make me stay

    





Into the nothingness of night, no more devoid of hope

Your star
No matter how far
Or in nearness, how bright
Though time does dim
And wear away at
The corners of your eyes
Near the edges of life
And galaxy's end
I, fear not lonely your presence
Only your absence of light
For it's within the sky
In this ocean of goodnight, alone
In which I could never shine
At least therein, without you
Beside

    





Intoxiceyes

Just a quick glance
A purple hue the wine a press
Dulcet and sweet
As it takes just an instant to confirm what she sees 
That he is lost in waters 
Deep in eyes shut
And unaware of all others in this lovers time

    





Introduce

Care, without a world in the air

And one leg propped up upon the other

      As if the universe didn't exist

      As if the words and thoughts were as one, unminced

And so I am introduced to you once again

My future friend

      Hello

    





Introverts

If this would unlock and unwind
Would you turn inward with me?
Just to ignore the world and all the people in it

Just for a moment
Could you forget about all that you’ve built alone?
And seemingly, be nothing with me? 

And when you look and see not the front of me
Would you take it as a complement? 
Not a slight 

Because alone together in the silence
And within the moment that will not last
Is exactly where I always hoped we could be

Unified and most alive in the nothingness 
Mirroring the moonlight back 
As if we were not passive 
 
At peace with each the other 
And the un-world we create 
Would you turn, unlock and look inward with me?

    





In truth (fireflies)

I cannot pull a star out of the night sky for you
But I can
With an uncupped hand
Coax every living firefly alive 
To glow for you

    





INtuitives

Please
Don’t ever think that you’re alone 
That no one has seen with similar eyes 
Or could understand the initial confusion 
That is, Inside

    





In Writing

The moment when you think about
The way it must begin or end
To rhyme or flow 
It’s there that you’ve lost the original thought again
For the sake of format
For the sake of style 
For the sake of trying to relearn what which you already know

    





I Rise

I fell a human
I will rise a human
And until I fall again
I will try
And they will know
Of this rising name of mine
Most fierce  

They fear me cause I rise

    





Iris Stars

A heart can beat
Without oxygen
For a minute
Starlight gleam 
For an eternity seem
A gander can fly 
Across the open sky
Till it's out of sight
And yet noone can reach you
Noone even tries
Because even fools recognize
The unobtainable
Untouchable height
That is your virtuous value
In my eyes

    





Isakov (dusty radio voice)

Your dusty radio voice 
Crackles in the closest way
And settles like the aero waves 
Of old refined 
So few to hear
Like perfect breaks in imminent line
Come other days 
Around and round
To search for more of your scotch refined sounds

    





Isildúr úm Dúnadan

Emerald eyes
Consuming flowers 
One crowned with white nobility 
One being still
Endlessly
Taillessly
Timelessly
Devoured

    





Is She

More delicate
And yet stronger in such ways
Unbeknownst to me

And yet this is why
When I look in her eyes
I see nothing of me

And yet everything 
I could ever wish to know
Is she

    





Itisanend

The best thing is. At the end of the day. It ends.

    





It is here

It's not the walls
Or the people same
Or the trains which make this place my own
Not the beaches which I joke about
Or the hilly slanted towny homes
It's the clouded skies and windmills wave
It's my own my spoken out in voice
In all that there is this homely place
And the power of my own my choice

It is here

    





It Is Like Boxing

What I do really is like boxing.

I throw out punches and mix with jabs.
Hitting the bag or person I see.

And if it comes back to me, at me?
I hit it again until it stays away.

Like boxing you see?
Most honestly.

    





It Is Love

Love is in the swell of the trees, the subtle breeze, 
Which for all of its might cannot be seen. 

It is love which shifts the steady feet, of the traveler. 
And moves in ways unbeknownst to me.

It is love which propels the honey bee, across the field, 
And back to the comb of bitter sweet. 

It is love which seeps through the autumn leaves, and tumbles down. 
Like the leaves before in the autumn breeze.

    





it's 10 a.m. and i want you to see me

look at me knowingly (thru
as I look at you)
as if we were two; the only hands to understand 
this universe suddenly grasping anew

look me up and with solitary in
through and thru as I'am to you

    





It's 2 A.M. And I Don't Know Nobody

"You know me
I'm just like you"
Said the street to the moon 
One reflective night
We are the same kind of vanishing day
And with a weary stroll 
Against our own better judgement
We fight

    





its 5am and i still miss you, a haiku

Cold coffee settles me
And stirs the morning into dew 
In a warm body

    





it's only because of your sound

Music patters everywhere 
Underneath little feet and rain alike
In falling, falling, falling out 
This sound it pours directly from
The trumpet of my soul

    





It's Only Natural

Hovering you is the drug which I dont know
Like the fever I could never shake
And the afternoon light
Just above the bitterroots below

How you fall like rain into becoming snow
And land with grace as I l've never seen
And believe me I've looked 
Upwards and for as long as stars aglow

Careening down in dreams
Flowing supple streams 
Whisper softly to each
The other of which we've yet to know

Carvings name of each not
In the remaining stone
Till the windy, trembling, peaks above
Comes crashing down, we awake alone

    





It's Time

All I have to give
All I have to spend and invest
All that is left
All that has been
And all that has past
Flows by me like a river now

Listen as you may and may try
Though you may never hear it howl
Because like death in the night 
It smiles wide at last
As it takes away with a cold hand
The moments as they seemingly pass 

Because we cannot bend nor deny 
The inevitability of the next day
Though we can regret and fondly remember 
The memory of those days gone by  

Why you may ask is all of this 
An inevitability and not such a crime? 

Well that would be because we are human
And it is the inevitability of time

It’s existence just like yours
Is no crime upon humanity

It simply is like you
Passing into eternity

    





It's True Anyway

Cloud and water 
Is a way of thinking 
Of presumptive of being

Which calms the minds 
Of those who see shadows 
In every corner

And demons in every shadow alike
Cloud and water 
And perfectly shapen sky

    





It takes too who

Love is a dance ... not a chase
And both partners need to step up
And do the ultimate about-face
And 
Embrace

    





i've done nothing in this somethingness

I've been so quiet and tired
so cold and concerned
with somethingness
that all I want is warmth 
and a nonexistence for a little bit

    





I've Missed The Drifting Stars

Cold trails
Dark sparks 
Wood chips drowning beneath waving path
No time 
No chance
No opportunity left to embark 

I've missed the stars 
The skyward boat
It's filling mast has sailed away 
And I am left standing
Beneath the reality
Of day

My reality
This day

    





Ivory Box

You are ivory magic without a single tusk taken
Boxes of fun without a single gift opened
More gold than any pocket, more silver than any second place token
You are the pounding crescendo in my head unbroken

Yes, I like your sound

    





Ivory Keys

Smashing ivory
Pounds like loving ***
But without the sudden sweet release
Instead
All there is left is ivory keys

    





I Want A Warmth To Share

Fitfully, I'm am the frosted earth 
Cold as winter lace falling songlessly 
Looking up at the sun in surface, longingly 

How I wish to be a bright furnace now, fiery  
Holding fast to the solemn heat abound
Hopefully, within our bed to be found

Yet I am cold

    





I Will Wait

Hear the howling cold of winter 
And know that warmth is in my heart 
Waiting for you throughout December 
With outstretched hands and spirit renewed
Know that every year I will wait for you

    





I Wonder...

After the newness of this new perspective 
Clears like a fog in the mountain pass 
What will you want then?
Soon after the end of this or that</em>?

I wonder...</em>

Where will you stand? 
And have you since realized the value stored within? 
So much so that it might make you want to go back?

    





jacaranda blossoms

Never stop 
Or in questioning fail
To bloom regardless of allergic beings 

Were you ever meant to stay 
Forever in the shade 
Of the nearby houses and skyward trees 

Always and intently 
You were ever meant to be
Blossoms floating down a Mississippi stream

Just to join in the open discourse
Of the most willing and most begotten
Lifelong love at sea 

So be
And never stop being

    





Jinn (A Haiku)

There is nothing there
Something always within me
Burning myself thin

    





Joe Black, A Tanka

Death came to dinner 
One day refusing to sit
As he was hungry
For more than the common man 
He wanted time itself, this

    





Jolted

Shocked* 
By the passing’s of perfume on a winters day
Wow, not why</em> 
Because you used to wear that scent

    





Jumping Horizons

Setting sun
Waning light 
Pull the string on this bursting chest 

Jump until it's perfectly timed
And fly 
For just a moment in hanging past

    





Jungian

Time is focus
Focus is energy
Energy, mentality 
And the mind is time
Unawares of me

    





Just an early morning ramble

Catch me like the flickering waves
Melding seamlessly into the horizontal sea 
Where your memories stare back at you and
Your unconscious eyes of being seek to be 

Catch me, my newfound find nearby
For I seek to live flyingly here in your eyes
For just a moment in being this order to free
And in your sight to see 

Because the words are my why
Just as these mine are me
Sometimes I write and describe 
Just to see if you will read

    





Just Before A Summer Storm

That smell
Just before a summer storm
Seeps into my eyes
As I am the only person left out in the rain
Under the sky
And the only thing which could clear my mind
Is the smell of lilac as it dies

    





Just Belief

I could euphorically find and dive into a pleasure yet know by this good man, goodnight. But I won't.  

I could buy myself tastefully, everything I could ever want in this life, and be perfectly lost for but a second. I know. 

I could kindle an old flame, stoking it bright, though all that would do is just burn us both. 

I could go out, be seen, eat my fill or hide. And in pretending so know that no one else does. 

I could try every old well-known thing under the sky and be unimpressed. I think.

Because the only thing that turns "I" away and doesn't circle back to "Me" is belief. Just belief.

    





Justice To Challenge

Justice isn't yours to challenge
Observe the only change with ease
It's best to simply let it be
As when you're not involved
In the sinfulness of it all
Don't let your mind wander for even a second
Instead be free, smile and flee

    





Just Let Me Feel My Feelings

You’d have better luck storing rain in your mouth 
Steadying quiet clouds with your eyes 
Alive

Mere perfection doesn’t exist I see
No
And the cake is a lie

It’s the desire to interject 
And infuse
Which I push against

Yourself insinuating from which I hide 

This look says <strong>me</strong>
Let me feel my feelings felt</em>
Or else there is no point left alive

    





Just Let Me Listen For Once

I love the sound
Like first of days
The kind which cuts through fires at night 
The kind which echos in the hallow mountains above
And winds down with little candles alive and bright  

And in burning for me 
Would you play without fear
Without self or acknowledgement of death 

Play
It doesn't matter how or what 
My dear

    





Just Look

There are those people who know things
Without even having to speak them
You just see them
And you know it to be true
That they are true 
How the music plays
The wind blows
And the eyes speak enough of what you both already knew

    





Just One Lifetime

There is more meaning I find in the Me</em> of You</em>
Than there are words in all of the pages transcribed by man

And no promise, dream or lie will ever suffice 
In communicating what I cannot

The importance of your existing to me
Be it only for this short period of time

Just once in a bitter little lifetime

    





Just Outside

To the sounding chill
Past the open sill
I could never compare 

My voice but a whisper 
And hers a symphony of a thousand crickets 
All performing piano consonance on the air

    





Just Outside of Frisco

When you are in Texas
The storm feels closer
The grass feels more vibrant
  Not greener, but strong
And the cool wind blows 
In a proud feminine way
Unpredictably beautiful

When you are alone and in Texas
You are peacefulness embodied
Tranquility on the edge of both war and throng

A wonderful feeling of being and belong

    





Just Runners In The Garden

Scarce were no more words than weeds 
In the garden of our perpetual being

Be they plucked or pulled
From tree born stars
Or shooting leaves across auburn eaves

How they fall so smoothly 
And with such succinct being
That they couldn't be misconstrued as less
Or more so present in our mutual meaning

We are a garden of bygone dreams
By the wayside of being
Been

    





Just so you know

I'm not a suitor
I am gray skies and bright suns 
From flying days past

That is all, a Haiku

    





Just So You Know

Dear ethereal nothing 
Having become rather fond of never
You will find me in an aching muscle dream 
The kind which lasts no more than fog
And clears like eyes with only blinks 
Observe my lostness if you must 
Find in it an ounce of head turn on my behalf
Or not, regardless
Look around and see this hollow earth 
These steady hands which know no more of thought
Than your heart of dose of sound
A letter wish this also reads 
But just in case your ethereal being has yet been freed 
I end this lay and say lay down my pen
Addressing this to the cosmos through 
And to no one in particular, this 
I still do

    





just wishing that I had someone

This rain has met its match in me
Such short ends becoming nothing

Bursting I am lonely at all
Not a heartthrob 

But tall as Pine and less of Willow

It’s just a breeze 

I ache when you’re not here

    





Khakis

I've since discovered — that the hardest part of seeing</em> (with such unique perspective) is to see</em> — what the person or pleasure actually is, and not what you think it is, was, meant, or could quite possibly be</em>.

    





Kiss

It's like the air molecules in front of you
Are split by the hands of a nether being
 And torn apart
As a new world opens up to you in an instant together
Never again to be closed and then
Never again to be one singular heart

    





Knives

The slowest pain 
  In the back to explain
    Is when someone you've known 
      All along from the start
        Pulls out the knife
      Slowly inching by inch
    Almost surgically
  Barely missing your original heart

    





Know Now

The goal is not 
To write as your most exaggerated self
No
The goal is to write the least like yourself
And the most like the feeling
Which you now know

    





Kosk Yn Ta (Sleep Ye Well)

With a gentle voice 
            Like blankets 
         Fall

    Midst stars from flowing ceilings
  Glow
      With residing smile

          Into blackness of fear
     Unbeknownst no more
              Know

   What is joy
         To be a joyful sunset 
     In the day of your child's life

    





Lack Of Light (HGS)

Dedication has a name
It was on your ID
But I couldn't see
Because it was too dark
And I didn't want to be a creep

    





Last

From the last</em> scribble
To the last</em> scrawl

The last</em> storm which last</em>s 
Beyond the last</em> hope in all 

Like a last</em>ing song 
Or the last</em> lengthy drawl

Let the artist draw last</em> 
What is meant to be drawn

    





Laughing Aloud In A Bookstore

My echoing laughter 
Catches the walls
Just below the ceiling 
When I see it again
In the reiteration of his own hand

That you were right
And the world was wrong
That it was not meant to be as this
A singing song 
But a reproach of the sigh
Of another man 

How clever of the Frost to hide 
On another set of snowy hands 
   
How clever indeed were you also to find
The original meaning of such a man

With props to you
I laugh again

    





Laughing at myself

Tasks are meant to distract the mind
Anyone who gardens by choice
To me
Is out of their own and doesn't have
Enough time, at least to think

An unpopular opinion, perhaps

    





Leaf or Leave?

Find me not beneath
A different sea of trees
For I will not, leaf?

    





Learning

Done
I am finished
Putting maximum effort
Into something that my heart is so minimally invested in

    





Less is such a human word

There are those who swim 
Through stone and oak
And cannot speak a word to crowds 
Nor care to feel what urchins lost
Or seek to speak what cannot be found

I am, I'm not
They are, they is

But the difference in being is none of this
The difference is just what is 
And is

Less is such a human word

    





Lessons of life and self I've found

I find
That some of the hardest things to do in life
Is to do for you
And not for me
To live for life
And as a being be
To let go of that
Which was never free
And to let yourself fade
With a gentling ease
For as sure as I am of many things
Theae are truly the most difficult for me

    





Let Go Of The Old

Forget them all and forget the calling
The rhyme, the reason, the motivation
Forget the original thought entirely
The process which has since passed you by
Forget it all
Just breathe on the ink and let it dry
Forget like the clouds overhead
And be free to fly between the pages
Unbound as the open sky
Since opening and letting go, and being all that you have been
Is not a sin 
Forget the details of the journey 
So that you may simply walk again
And discover the mindfulness within
Forget and let it begin again

    





Let Love And Coffee

Let love 
Command what the heart desires
And for everything else
There’s coffee

    





Let Me Show You This Feeling

The crush of shells beneath warm feet
The whirr of petals above the September streets
The cooling feeling of evenings alive
The Moon over Atlantic eye
The hint of lingering sand everywhere
The smell of wicker seats in the morning air 
And the scent of steaming shrimp to eat
Mouthwatering dreams and memories 
And everything bread mixed by the sea
How these fragrances linger here in my everywhere
And make me want to be we again
With you in this place, still there

    





Let Rivers Pass You By

Close your eyes
Stand in the river 
Let all of the waters whip past you by
Though you be made of similar materials found
You are no less running
Ever moreso alive 
Than the current to be found around
Let the waters pass you by

    





Let's Drink

Coffee smooth as scotch and butter
Tea to last an hour past
And wine as vineyards stretching out 
Let's drink until the cows are stars
The comets turn cold coming home
As a shipping roost will do for us
Let's drink not though we must

    





Let The Past, Be Past

The moment you worry
About the days which are gone
You create the current warry
About what you couldn't control

    





Letting It Rust

I will let the enamel rust
If that's what it takes
To remove
The enamored me

    





Life A Bridge

Winding these words
For a rope to you
Across a narrow bridge collapsed
Will you 
Outreach, outstretch
To catch last
At the end where we both
Find findings true

    





Life, A Coffee Dream

As if every coffee cup ever filled was an ocean
So every drink ever drank by humanity was a dream
A beautiful dream with an inevitable end
Like a swirling coffee steeped in seeping cream
Forever mixed are our drinking lives with dreams
One and the same once turned knowingly

    





Life As A Coin

Polish a coin until it shines 
A coin it still remains 

Scratch the surface, smash the matter on the tracks 
And yet the etching still ingrained  

Flattened to the edge of flat
So the world around remains 

As a coin which flips is falling fast 
With fate less interchanged
 
No bounce determines forward path 
Which wasn't first ordained 

Mere steadfast midst matters of the past
For we all in life break change

    





Life As A Raindrop

Think as raindrop falls
Fast
Exclusively towards it's goal and aim
Without hope it falls short
Of becoming snow 
Although sometimes as rain it does not remain

    





Life At Sea

The moment you are most comfortable
The moment you are free
Is a lie... Or so I think

Because the next wave is on it's way 
And soon you will be crashing down
Just like the wave...

Because life and love I view like this
Though most around you do not know
That they are tossing in the sea

There will always be another wave
Moving towards our solemn shores
Crashing into you and me

    





Life of Falling Snow

The snow starts
The snow stops
Unknowing weather 
It wants to fall 
Or not at all
Finding unrest on our country streets
Dear friendship atop tiny trees
As it thinks it's way
Both in and out of existence cold
Melting worries until
Surrounded by water 
It is no longer standing still
Let alone growing old

    





Life Uncomfortable

Disconnected from the comfort
But not the truth indefinitely
You see
All about how it works and is
But you cannot see yourself at work in it
Comfortably

    





Life Will Never Wait

Real life is neither the work nor the time spent waiting inbetween. The sacrifice or the freedom perceived. No, there is more to it now than there has ever been. Due to the congruent moments and the minutes passing. Because the real exists, not at the initial signs of belief. But at the time at which you realize that, you began long ago almost instantly.

    





Lightning Fast

Still your head
Steady it
Give yourself some time to react 

Clear your eyes
And take a breath 
Before you plunge back underneath 
And immerse yourself 
Within the mess 

Envision how it has to be 
And plan it out 
Picture the objectivity

Would you see the future you’ll create 
Just in front of you
A moment before it has to be 

And then be fast 
Like a lightning bolt
Let your hands and eyes simply react 

And meet the ball most suddenly 
To elicit the lightning
And make it crack

Picture this an you will be
All at once
Lightning fast

    





Lightning Tanka

Thunder strikes sudden
Blanking conscious volts and jolts
So fast that being
Fails to be aware of self
Old heartbeats stop as of now

    





Light Pollution

A world exists beyond the streets
And corners covered by these city lights

Where a gentle patter is beating down to a different kind of rain

And the moonlight falls, burning memories into our wooden hands and arms 

Trust me when I say that such a world exists 
Where there is only thing left to fall
And that is the whisper of a pindrop as it breaks

For as far away from these blinding bulbs and city squalls, it waits
Forever and always, standing out in the pale moonlight
Just as far away as it takes

    





Light Polution

Chances are
When there's not a star in the night sky
That it's you who cannot see past the light
And the pollution you choose to allow in your eyes

Just as the stars are always there
He IS
Never far from out of sight

    





Like A Knife

It's getting better
But every time the sun sets
On another age
Another opportunity 
My heart sinks 
A few inches more
Deeper into my chest

Although there's nothing more to be done
I wish that such things would pass me by
And leave my heart alone at last

Although it's getting better
I wonder what will remain of me
And who I will be
If I survive to see it pass

    





Like An Arrow

Desire a man who walks a straight path 
Keen as the cutting edge 
Straight as an arrow and deep to sink 
That way in him you may always be found 
Like the mountain pass 
Taken higher than the clouds  
And never disgraced, degraded or sunk down

    





Like A Part Of Me

I miss you,
More than anyting.
More than earth and sky and sea.
I miss you,
And the sight of you, which I've yet to see.
And I wish you were here,
So that I could ask you about you,
And inadvertently learn something new about me.

    





Like A Spiderweb

You shake me like a spiderweb
Reverberate the edges of my mind
Until the very essence of you spreads
And you are attached
To every corner of every structure 
Which I've slowly built up inside of my head

    





Like A Tree

I can see myself 
Like a tree
Twisting and turning 
Growing 
Into an adult me

    





Like Boxing

Poetry should be like boxing, 
Short, swift, and powerful.
To the point and presented so that you never see it coming. 
A hook, a jab, a firm right cross. 
Hard hitting and unforgiving, 
Never what you are expecting. 
Watch it on your cable boxes, 
Cheer and scream till you're obnoxious, 
Because poetry should be like boxing.

    





Like Cider

I am like cider
Well preserved 
Always available and warm
Though only appreciated in the fall
Or at least so I feel
Slightly fermented

    





Like Coffee

The truth is not at the bottom of a cup
Nor beneath the Saucer underneath

No words can hold the sacred truth
Just as two cups cannot guarantee
That two minds will ever meet 

No, the truth is out there on each table
Waiting for all who would simply sip

The truth that is, the truth is this
That regardless of wherever we may be
The truth is something that simply is

Much like this coffee 
Honest with a breath of heat
Or possibly even cold and sweet

Such truth is always percolating
Even if we cannot taste or see
The words of God, resting gently underneath

    





Like Fire

A cylinder of burning flame, standing tall in the dead of night. 
With wisping smoke and warming waves I radiate. 
Emulating the fires of old, which charred the brick and mortar stone of a fireplace. 
Like the flames which gave you first your warmth, turn now to me. 
A fiery ember burning fast, a glutton for your oxygen. 
My lifeless love will ever last. 
Until the waters poured upon me turns the lye from Phoenix ash. 
I am your love. 
Your lonesome fire. 
A comet in the sky to pass.

-SS

    





Like The Palm

Have you met the creases in my hands
Shocked you must be to know
That I've known them all along

    





Like The Sky

From the height of my eyes 
Scraping hair often spiked 
And cloudy thoughts 
Who’d of thought
That’d I’d wish to be seen 
In such a ways as this 
Be it always by you
Was the only hope 
In me

    





Like What Love

Deep like oceans
Flowing like rivers
Falling like leaves 
And growing like trees 
     Running like the animals atop the earth 
     Sounding like horns on the holy night
     And burning like the sun in the summer sky 
          True like the words the apostles did speak 
          And round like the earth with its edges beneath
               Stained like ink
               And pressed like books
               And tested like an automobile which looks 
               Like Christmas morning gifted to man
                    Like the clattering of pots and pans
                    And the soothing touch of a mothers hand
                         Like this, like that
                         Is what love is to me
                              But what love is for you
                              May still yet to be seen

    





Like Wine

I want to want her like a glass of wine
With an endless taste, and a deep draft
Waiting for me at the end of each day 

Bitter and sweet like the summer tea  
With a hint of dandelions, and her hair brushed gently away    

Although this is me...you need not see, or want her in a similar way
But it's best if you could acquire the taste. 

Because when you hold an endless glass 
You can sit and sip your life away 
Without care or concern for those moments past 

Slowly like a semisweet 
A Merlot or Chardonnay

How I want to want her like a glass of win
So that I can drink her in 
And be drunk on her at the end of each day

    





Like With Like

A thinking boy needs a thinking girl. Someone who knows some of, but not the sum of, what is in his or her own head.

    





Limits

I try and eat the world sometimes
With a mouth unhinged
And it doesn't work out 
It won't fit in

    





Line of Sight

Don't Lose Yourself
Remember who you are
You have things and you want things
You've become things and you're becoming things
Beautiful, good and decent things 
Which bring great joy to the one true ruler 
And honor to your rightful king
So don't lower your gaze or piercing sight
For ANYTHING!  
</em>For anyone who has no claim 
Or cannot understand the way 
That your eyes tend to see such things
Designed as they were for such a struggle
Born and bread for such a fight 
For such a sight
Don't lower your line of sight for anything

    





Listening To The Rain

If you need me
I’ll be floating
Awash in a puddle of memory
Unaware in a sea of opportunity

    





Littering

A gentle, delicate, beautiful hand
Extends from the Excursion
And drops a can 
Ugh, what a hideous hand

    





Little Birds

Homeless is the bird which flies from tree to tree.
And so are we...
So are we...

    





Little Screens

When did our altered
   culture decide 
     that WE 
       would be happy 
         with our little screens
           and such little stillness
             within our lives
               ?

    





Little Things

When one man says
"All the little things"
He is looking into the eyes of her
In love and drunk on summers wine
Before the winters fall
As if the endless summers were yet alive on this earth

When in reality
"All of the little things"
We do, and say, and act to be
Are but seasons we have aligned with time
Are but dusty feelings
Stirring occasionally in a field full of tempered streams

    





Live Like Rainfall

There cannot be a new being of you
Until you stop clouding the same old skies
With the comfortable grey you've known
Since you last tried
But instead 
Let it rain until the rain is through
Let it rain and then
 Even when it hurts and all which you desire is behind you

    





Live Your Life In The Storms

When the stormy days come
     And do not leave

When you're turning like the July wind which rolls
     Through the summer trees 

When the walls seem dry 
     And the wells turn warm 

When the childlike embrace 
     Finally runs to the storm

When all of these things happen
     When all of these things combine 

When the rainy season comes
     There's no reason to hide 

Live your life in the storm
     Waste no moment alive

    





Living Days

If you are the dawn 
Awake and alive
Then I am the moment of the day which breaks
And turns into the bitter night

My own masked by starlight
Your left alone crowned with a sparkling retina alive

It's to you that I turn
At the end of all things
When the day first began to realize its own light

We are young and alive 
Ever ready to strive
Towards the hours invested within, without sight

    





Locked Away

Sometimes I seek the solitude of a quiet room, just to hear my mind speak aloud. To question all that I've built in this world, and whether or not I am allowed, to act on it. 

Should you ever find me doing this, don't judge me for it, and don't question it.

Because believe me if I knew why my mind requires this. I wouldn't have to close the door, or lock myself externally in.

I guess sometimes what is inside, is not always willing to coincide, with what the heart tries to keep alive. And this is why sometimes I hide.

In order to unlock the locked away inside.

    





Lone

Some days you just feel
As man was not mean to be</em>
Alone

    





Lonesome Tree

Lonesome tree, 
Left to stand in a field of green. 

You are as free as free can be, at least as much as a tree can be. 

You’re the sole survivor of a proud oak line, 
And the tallest timber I’ve ever seen in this area of the countryside. 

Only you have lived long enough to see the red sunrise.
The lidless moon and the eye of the storm sent by the sea. 

It baffles me, that you a tree, would watch over a farmer and his family. 
Your rightful and natural enemy, who pushes the plow beneath your feet.

Surrounded by a society which cuts down all of your company, 
Just to build and sow with lesser seeds.  

And yet you, the mightiest of trees, refuse to pack up root and leave? 
Refuse to let yourself be twisted by the progress of humanity.

Why are you doing this? 

I guess no greater love exists, 
Than to share your shade with your enemies. 

Thank you for this, oh lonesome tree,
You are a symbol of life to me.

    





Lonesome Words

With no words written on the wall
Lonely is a man's heart
At least when trying to balance out
The respect, and the desire to call
For this true
That lonely is a man's heart in all
When there are no words left for him at all

    





Look And See

Look into my eyes and see whatever you can. 
For I have passed over, 
And I become the former friend. 

Though before you my feet may shimmer and stand. 
You cannot see the path before me,
Nor the direction which my heart demands.

Like a wanderer, I'm an invisible man. 
Standing beside the traveling son, 
With the comrades in their own travelin band. 

The rugged, the ragged, the weary souls. 
Such tiresome eyes will always know,
What the steady feet will not understand, 

So look into my eyes and see, 
Whatever it is,
Whatever you can.

    





Look and see the setting snow

Hoarfrost hugs me closer than
these sounds of something 
in this quiet night
And the sky, the sky, shines brightest
beneath these trees in reflective thought 
In looking I am reminded 
of my being alone and alive

    





Looking Around Trees

When I breathe
You breathe 
And when you look past the greening summer trees 
I see 
Like Julia Stone 
That same essence of the world unknown
And still unknown to me

    





Looking down at a love

Though you may squint,
And look and see,
And maybe catch a glimpse perhaps

In remembering your past,
In looking up most lovingly

That was the past,
And you're no longer that

And now, this present sight,
Is me

    





Looking Onto Ponds

Deep beauty 
Steady silence
And ripples stirring into waves
Unchurning days besought with shadows
And a shying sky which looks
And gazes longingly beneath
At each of these
One blue, one clouding grey
Begotten eyes

Only to see what I can see
At the end of whipping, curling, line

    





Looking Up

Dreams are...
Like the stars
Unreachable but
Still embedded
Within existence

    





Looking Up I Am Lost Beneath

Ruminate through me as the ache of trees
The quiet joyful tears of rain
Which ripple and shake
The ground beneath 

These stars, this shimmering gleaming shine
Never tasted half so sweet in mind
As when I am with you
And underneath

    





Looking up is a need

Yes, self
Reading is romantic still
If it's done by a supermodel 
Sure

Noone is coming to turn your eyes like pages
Sorry

    





Looking up to see

A cloud is your salvation shown
People a drug
....
In the focus of your selfless self
What wonderful distraction, who?

In looking sees just above the trees
That all is white, and gray, and blue
...
Just out of reach and occasionally seen
There is no peace, even when alone

With occasional rain and blotted sun
Such light and bouncing white renewed
...
It's a constant reminder of what is above
And what beneath you cannot do

    





Look Up And See

When all around you is falling down
When the grass and trees and cricket sounds
Are no more there alive than dead
When your world is crashing inside out
To sky be bound
Look up instead

When the rolling clouds are sounding out
And the river ink is pouring down
And the flood is in your basement found
Stand proudly upon on your here and now
Don't sink your brow 
Look up instead

When the voices jeer you all about
And the rumors populate the town
When commotive chaos finds your head
Don't let the horizon slip you now
Though falsehood fed
Look up instead

And when the never becomes the now
And the time like nightfall pulls you down
When the sunshine strays its fading stead
May the storms internal you allay
In peace be found 
Look up instead

    





Looping Songs

And suddenly with bass
The speakers explode in an old home
Like a storm blown over a country complete
As all the inhabitants of this one mind know
That this song is new 
And while it glows with coals turned blue
It will newly be here on repeat

    





Loss of Sensation

I don't want much
Or need another to hold my hand
There's not much left to be found of us
(Thank God)
I just want to taste
I just want to be able to smell the sky again

    





Lost

I haven't felt at home since then
Since I've woken up
No dream can last
All nights must pass
And rise again

But my realization hasn't changed
The way things are or could've been

Look back and see the same old day
Not as it was, but as it is

No amount of time can change the fact
Or the truth therein 

That we are searching, ever searched 
Alive within for but a short time

    





Loud Mouth

You keep on spitting it out 
From your couch "my friend"</em>
Because you know where I'll be

Working furiously as ever before
Until all of the flaws are ironed out
And there's nothing left of you but your mouth 

Just sit back and relax as you always have
And then comment on what THIS</em> is really about 

How I did what I said, and I said what I am 
When I jumped up and stomped on the top of these clouds</em>

Hopefully then you'll discover quite quietly how  
To have a sensible song tucked away in your mouth

    





Love a flood, Love a drought beside

There are days when love is deeper than oceans
Running faster than faucet rivers at a head
And rolling quicker than wheels over hills and sleds through snowy dales intact 

And then slower days of not (in love) arrive 
With a scorching sun that never sets
And a chilling mournful eye in the night sky

My guess is that
In love we are tides
Simply unaware of our own comings and goings

How we ebb and flow until we die
In love

    





Love An Unintroduced Tanka (S7)

Distant as you are
Undiscovered yet in sense
And sensory ways
Known is no keeping us here
A part from these distinct days

    





Love Before Lasting Sight (Can Tell)

No paint speaks for me
My favorite words fall utterly short 
And I, no song could ever be you 
And yet I can see you here 
Before you are known
Before you exist in this world of mine 
I can see you as if you were in present time 
Just as if you were already mine

    





Love Each Day, A Tanka

Kiss this youthful day
With a passionate prose tongue
And hold her hands close
As if tomorrow wont come
Though it ever will do so

    





Love Is Ever Wild

Less than sun and more than sky
Which holds above the clouds untamed 
More wild and freely kept than these
The rugged lylac enthused hillsides
Just beyond my reach
Which as a child ever passed me by
And nowso you are more to me 
And will ever be such
Most wild and free beside
Me

    





Love Is Like String

Is love a fancy or a feeling or a fascination? 
You tell me 
Although my mind is already made
And made up like the corners of my bed sheets

Your grandparents will tell you one thing, your parents another
And the youth amidst the feeling will tell you something else entirely

 You know what I think? 
Do you even care? 
Will anyone even hear this little thing? 
That love is a decision made every day
To let go, to hold on, to cut loose, and to cat's cradle string 

The same old yarn or balers twine 
Which you first used to tightly wind 
The cord around your loving life

You picked your husband
You chose your wife
Now chose whether or not you'll live 
An ever loving daily life

    





Love Is Not Love Apologetic

When choice is not a matter of heart
Or sight a glance at sun kissed chin
Arise my dawning love, arise 
Don't look away 
I'm not sorry that we must being

    





Love Life

They ask me if I’m with anyone…
If I’ve found anyone in my place of need?
Or if by chance she happened to walk on by
Down the other side of the same street
Just right past me?

To which I have always and often replied
Feigning a smile of effortless ease
That they shouldn’t worry about such things
Because my love life will stroll at whatever pace
And down whatever street that it does please

    





Lover of thought

When you're young
You think you know

Can diagnose 
And speak for a self

Who is infinitely older
Than that which is shown

When you're young - You think
And that's the problem 

You may be able to guess
But you'll never know

    





Lovers beneath night

Moonlight is a special ray
Which falls reflective upon us all
Not all, or all the time, at all

But slowly, and somberly, and softly
It starts with an edge of blue alive
And moves like a slow dance between stars ignite 

Moonlight, my old friend
Even now in my minds eye
Over top of us, together, it comes to call

    





Lovers haiku

The edge of night now
Holds nothing to your sunlight
Frame outlined by day

    





Lovers in tandem

Balance like the ocean tides
The pull of leaves, and lifting words
Which coat the trees in wind and song

The hum of every burning star
Which falls in arching patterns long

The glowing cats and caterpillar eyes
The worms which gnaw the earth below
And the longing of the youthful juvenile dog

Our earth she looks and see all of these
As I look at you now, knowing that I belong

    





Lovers voice in my inbox

Even tree whispers 
Cannot compare 
To the words once left
In perpetuity, mine
To touch and kiss
With loving ears
To caress and ever remind 
This mind
Of the way you once
Would leave words behind

For me

    





Loves First Sight

Let not the stubbornness stored away within your heart, 
Deny your head the happiness,
And the ease of truth within the mind. 
Which is found only when two similarities collide. 

Because the inverse breaks the mirror indefinitely, without reflection. 
But the same eyes resonate, 
And reverberate both the feelings and the sight therein. 

Enjoy the memory of the crossroads where love first met it's counterpart.
Oh, how I pray that you can let yourself live to see such a sight.

    





Love The Choice

Live not for love the feeling
It will let you down inevitably
Love then to live the choice of you
The decision to be 
The WITH because of what is good and true

    





Loving Arms

How patient are the arms of the trees 
To hold out and hold on
To the weight of the weighed winters snow
In place of their own
Their children, their leaves 
Which have long since left left for the distant ground 
Having moved on to another town
How they’re holding on and beholden now
How kind are these?
Such winter trees

    





Loving True Takes Time (A Tanka)

Rushed is not a true
Excuse for making something 
As premature as
Life without embodied love
Let alone two lovers lost

    





Luminous Colors

Wash over with your iridescence 
And waver slowly just above the scene 
Mere feet away or miles now, I cannot tell?
Though your iridescent qualities may be seen 
Forever in the waters quelled

    





Magic Or Poetry

Prestige with me most humbly,
As I paint you a picture never before seen. 

Hear my words before I speak, 
And gravitate ever so slightly towards the edge of your seat. 
Such magical words do not come with ease. 

They are the result of craft and timeless tries. 
Again and again to coincide, 
Within the lock and key inside. 

Yet I escaped like Harry the great, 
Call me a magician by twist of fate. 

So I shuffle the words for all to see, 
And deal them out most graciously. 

Captivating the audience, 
I line the Jacks in rows and stacks. 

Only to quietly turn them back,
Into the deck where I escaped, 
Into my hand which hold their fates. 

And hopefully by watching me the crowd escapes, 
Into the the purely predestined fate,
Into the magnificence I create.

    





Make new memories with me, please

This anxious memory of my own
Is a wish to be free
Like a cloud to return
How it longs to be rain
Set resting on the forgotten ground

    





Makes Me Laugh

My own mother called me an adult today
How dare she
Without even seeing what I've become
Know

    





Mansion

I want to be a wing of your mansion 
Close the door on me if you like
But I'll always be extensive
No door can hide what's left behind
And just behind 
The light within a man's eyes

    





Manthem

Though my hand my waiver
And my pen fall silent as smoke 
For an age as long as the disenfranchised believer 

So all fevers break 
And to wellness, sky, and oceans turned gray 
My mind will take

Just as my heartbeat knows no break
And my memories moreso ache 
As the thousand stars burn 

It's your turn 
My friend

    





Many Partings

Old friends fade like sun-filled days
And last no longer than the rain
Which turns to winters waste above
 
And yet
I grow like trees 
Even when I don't want to

And see them go below 
To death 
Where these memories and away friends go

Into the un, "I do not know" them

    





Many Years A Line

Is there no one left who has walked this line of mine?
It might as well be a tightrope at this point
So rigid and refined 
(by comparison)

    





Maranatha - Maybe Today

As a lover says I will return
Just before the extended loss of stay
Be it echoed over mountains past
Or etched in stillness contemplation
The tongue in all of its self-proclaimed wisdom
Finds no words less, no more deserving
Then the faithful say
And cry on high
Saying Maranatha – Maybe today

TBC

    





Maybe, Let It Be

Maybe if I organize
My soul so that it shines once more
Not like my pictures on the wall
Or books aborn, in elevens stored 
If these staggering frames cannot give way
To the host of clearer thoughts they be
Then give and give of another hope, perhaps
And if I finally it let be, maybe

    





Mayer Maybe

Have you ever had a song repeat? 
And turn you a certin way? 
For in passing I see
Now that Mayer maybe
When he said
"Would you say what you need to say?"

Such is a necessity

    





May Isn't For Rain

This is me
Standing on a tower cold
Pushing up the clouded skies
With fingers stretched wide
Trying to hold back the rainy clouds
Until this imitation month
Which proclaims to be a daughter of May
Proceeds to pass us by

May isn't for rain

    





Mean, Doesn't Mean

The love of my life doesn't mean
Heart and soul
It means choose and choice
Part and whole

    





Meaning And Being

The greatest trap of all for mankind 
Is that of being and not being
And when there is no God 
Not being begins to look awfully friendly

    





Meant To Touch (like clay)

Cold clay cannot be coaxed
Without warmth of fingers
Pressed and felt

No mold ever existed without mind behind
Or sculptor without a wheel to turn

Just as fingertip valleys were always meant

    





Melting Sands

I am the fire beneath the sands of time
Worn and torn into a thousand pixels 
Burning bright in the last hour of daylight 
Beneath the surface 
I am the last step of the marathon
The breaking of the tickertape 
And the blackness of the screen beneath 
And at the same time
I am fire
I am all of these
Alive

    





Memoric Love

The lover on the other line
Who whispers nothings 
Literal nothings
Isn't real 

She's just the memories which
I'm inclined to think about
And yearn to kiss
Again and again

    





Memoric Lover

I'm not dragging your frame through the mud of memory
Nor lifting up falsehoods in the mind of once mine
No I live and live in a constant state of both being and remind
I remember because it once was us who lived
Can't forget because such things should never die

And they can't 

He said with a smile

    





Memories A Drink

Cold where it meets the tongue 
Warm in the mindful eyes relived 
Turn up the heat in this solemn room
As it is all that I can do to relive this again

No home, no food, no time left to return
Let alone option to be a companion 
As I of the few who remain
Sum of less who survived let alone to thrive

And in breathing I, no, all of this is against me
Every ounce and pound of reality found 
In the noise upstairs and the quite beneath
Down below the surface once paid for dearly

But I can touch my lips to a glass of memories 
And taste every Saturday of childhood overflowing
As I am there again
But not there at all

    





Memories I Can't Remember

White flowers on a sleeping river
Clear glass waters of a Mnemonic ripple 
How I beg and plead to be remembered, this feeling 
Of my own feet standing in this euphoric dream
Dearest of mind
Don't end again and make me wake 
Don't leave this river to unwind

    





Memories Of My Favorite Town

Softly does this song extend
Out a gift of memory back in time

To the touch of wallpaper and pillow down
The same smell of pretzels and of youth
And of the quiet Summer nights before the fall of June
Found only before and once well known
I will not forget that quiet little town
Or all the trust that it had in me
As I laid there late at night and on the ground

We understood each other
Did we not?

    





Memories Which Often Make Home (Winter)

With memories mine 
Soaring higher than kites in the sky 
How I yearn to hear the winter fireflies glide 
Flickering in the December sparks ignite

    





Memory

Not the aimlessness
Indecisiveness
Or the constant lack of questioning 
No 
None of that
But I’ll always remember her raven hair in a spiral stair 
And the jealousy in her sister’s eyes

    





Memory, A Tanka

Does the earth ever
In a fit of feeling fear
That her daughter trees
Will uproot too much too far
From her no child ever leaves

(Memory)

    





Memory Sky

Clearer than any settled pool 
Brighter than any firework sky 
Fresher than any daisy or flower 
More real than any polished rock to remind

Falling fast and furious in mind 
Like a stonework leaning slow built tower
With a buzzing hum as a furious fly 
And sanguine light midst reflective pool

I remember it like it was yesterday
Because it was just 3674 days ago

    





Mere Want

You know,
You want,
You sure?
Because...
What I want is no mere simple thing. 
What I want,
Is her.

    





Merit

What is man without action?
Resulting choice? 
What is a man without action indeed?
Just a voice.

    





Message In A Bottle

I cannot help but wonder,
About you and where you are.
A person who sees truth in me,
Behind the mask and scars.

You're someone who speaks in silence,
And someone who knows the sound,
Having heard another heartbeat,
Be it simple or profound.

Yes you have heard and you can listen,
Even if it’s just to me.
Because of who you are in earnest,
Apparent truth within your plea.

That is your words are wise and waiting,
Searching desperately to find,
Another pen another heartbeat,
To match your own in ink and mind.

-SS

    





Messages to No One

Shadow, a scar across his face
Scratched unknowingly upon his own

Not to worship the self 
Or the look therein 

But to escape the external realities known
The distant typing of the alone

    





Middle Ground

I refuse to not try 
Let alone die 
For the life I could potentially lead
Therefore you see
That I must try
And thay there is no in between

    





Midnight Fires

Maybe this summer?
Maybe these stars?
Will be the distant midnight fires
Which will look down upon this tired old heart
And rejoice as it falls
Endlessly
Stumbling upon the greatest love of all

    





Midnight Midst Snowglobe

Ghostly shadows are consumed in little bites by winter's snow. Sparking alive in moonlight gleam, without so much as a firey wave. But moreso gentle with watery winds which blow. 

No place to hide beneath root and stem. No aching hand without feelings felt, in the heart of it all where such steadiness flows. 

Without single eyelash out of place, it remains in time and simple sight, the center of this most orbital glow.

And globe.

    





Midnight Need

I need to know
Or else I'm afraid, that I must go 
Quietly into this good night

Because not knowing
Of this so and so
Destroys my heart and plagues my mind

Every... Single... Time....

    





Mindful Eyes

Her hair alive
A life of its own

With waters clear
And mindful eyes

Ever wide awake
As if with sound

Be it nothing at all
She is ever still

    





mindful (sight)

there is the seeing
and the steps between 
to take yourself there
to where you think
(you need to be)

    





Mind I See

Don't challenge me, I am not a machine. I am flesh and blood and a heart which beats, twice as fast as the former me. Hence why these words speed rhythmically from within my cheek. 

One day my friend, one day maybe, you will spit my name from between your teeth. As I show you just how many mysteries can reside inside a man such as me.

Young wild and free, with intuitive eyes I often see, what others can only try and perceive. Attempt to hide, and shroud your mind in structured subtlety. 

Overt your eyes away from mine, if you do not wish for me to see. Because this is the gift God has given me. And to not use it is to deny both the former and the present me. Like the blue in my eyes, know this. I see.

    





Mind Soup

I cannot clear the palate of my mind with all of this noisy taste embodied.

    





Mind You

It’s not about romanticizing the failure 
But realizing the redundancy 
The struggle to be thankful and kind
In a world full of fleeting feelings blind

Mind you

Encouragement often flees from truth 
And the staying therein of proof 
Is what's easier said than done
Not to mention most often true

    





Minimum66

Not every verse has to be a journey
Not every person a means of influence for you 
So take care of that smallness — of mind
midst package — I pity your perspectiveless, less, untrue

    





Miranda

Mirrored like a windowpane
I know you’re there, but not at all
No great height at last it would be
To fall like this, endlessly
Into the wellspring of it all
But to a craft and wet stone be
The way you hone the idea smooth 
Like a riverbed, put me to rest 
And toss me as a stone unto
And in doing so 
Smooth me into you

    





Miscommunication

No more multitude of messages
Wasted words poured down a cavernous collapsing career of communication 
Instead, crashing doors will be all in ears
Reverberating, on the day I leave this place for you

    





Miss Brown Hair

I remember you    like my last breath
      Always 
   And           Yet never
Fully aware

    





Missing

Quiet lips
I want to kiss
More than any girl right now
I miss
The silent whispers in the trees
The quiet hour on the back of the moon
And my ears full of you
Miss nothingness
How your quiet lips find only words
And thoughts within
To manifest
How I miss you now like I’ve missed my room
And the space within 
To acquiesce

    





Missing Miss

I miss the way we used to sit
How you'd fall asleep on my shoulder cold

How you quietly would look at me, and I at you, because we'd know

I miss the everyday secret things
Which we used to do and could've been

With a oneness and once unified breath
I miss these more than anything

    





Miss Jones's Heart

Would you find me a girl with the bravery and boldness of a Coraline Jones's heart? 
Not someone who demands my attentive love or the backing of a musical score.
But someone real. 
Someone who knows every deep and dark and shallow fear. 
Someone particular and peculiar. 
Who perhaps I can make a cheese omelette for.

    





Miss Mist

Beautiful, sweeping, seeping mist 
  Don't weep for me your gentle tears
  But kiss the trees as only you can
Before their youthful leaves turn Gold
  To be plucked or pulled down by the wind
Bewitch the spell till summer comes
  And turn the Falls' head with drizzlin'
As you clasp bare limbs in paleing hands
  Would you kiss the trees as only you can?

    





Miss Playlist

She is nothing more
Than a playlist in a database
Which I never adored 

Stored away in an ancient file on an aged server
But the list remains there anyway
Be it out of respect 

So you need not worry about such a voice
Interjecting itself back into my life

When the truth is that 
I know the sound which a whole heart makes 
And hers was fragmented 
By the pain which she always put on repeat

    





Missrays

You are pure sunlight 
With no oath to shine
And yours is the only reflection I see 
In the moon sometimes 
When the night is young and hopeful
When all is everything and in infinite time
You'll question no such reflective being
But instead open seeing and find

    





Miss Serendipity

Buttons couldn't describe you, 
Nor a picture or portrait to compare. 
Your smile indescribable, 
Neath iron straightened golden hair. 

A shadow in your eyes I see, 
Your arm inscribed serendipity. 
An unforgotten commodity, 
An awe inspired oddity, 
But what aspires you to me, 
Is the winding way your eyes did see.

Before the corner first was turned, 
Before the present came to be. 
What was the sight which turned your way? 
What overshadowed your luminosity? 

I wish my friend that you would smile, 
For everyone not just for me. 
In light of this stay positive, 
And smile miss serendipity.

    





Miss Sunrise

This sunrise is very beautiful 
With a hue of pink and a rareness which 
Befits the weariness of red eyes 

As slowly over the Catskills she 
Rises and resides
Until she can be seen within the sky 

Pure as almond and ivory  
Backed by the dawn and the day alike

Who am I to stand here in her way? 
Who am I to say that she shouldn’t try? 

I can only trust and occasionally wish 
That she would honor me with a simple kiss 
Of morning dew, and a smile wide

For that, in this, my morning eyes  
Would bring great joy to me in my life

    





Moaning Minnie

Certain songs
Set off steps

Satin steps 
Across the wall

Climb the house
From the inside out

Fred, my friend
You out rotate them all

    





MONOLOGUE I

You are not just the hero within the pages of your own story. You are the vessel of intuition. The growing understanding of self-undiscovered, be it in the conscious or unconscious arena. Competing with all under the sun. You live not to forget or yourself become the great shining deeds by which you may never achieve relics. But to bear witness to the self and its finite attempts to grow steadily alongside the tree of life. And in standing therein, rooted, smile at your own death. Knowing a more practical end awaits you moving.

    





Mononoke

Wild and untamed. 
She stretches out, like a shadow from the base of a tree. 
Features pale as the river shale, eyes cool and clear like the rushing stream. 
A forest child with a wild streak. 
Intent on keeping the forest free of pestilence. 
She roams the earth, with a pack of wolves her pounding feet. 
Yet she cares for all of the birds and beasts, as if they were her family. 
Like a ghost so she appears to me, beyond trees. 
Her Mononoke name be known, but behind the mask I'll never see.

    





moonlight heart

When my moonlight heart
Awakes 

And cries eternity asleep no more
She says
“you do not know
where you are as of late” 

And with a bright flash of light
So her insult speaks
And slowly resonates 

And I then
Will inevitably wake 
Just to contemplate

    





Moon Sight

With that same young moon smiling down
At that which was never this separated us
With a smile alive, I'm not surprised
As my prayer was granted 
Though I'll never forget the sly expression
Just below and beside my own eyes

    





More

The most difficult thing about knowing more
About realizing that someone is capable of more
Is that you may come to expect, and desire more
Which becomes more apparent, when only one mind adores

    





More About Skiing

This mountain knows my every move
From memories pulled like frigid springs
It remembers how my childish feet
Once loved to steer, and weave, and groove
This mountain knows my through of through 

And even when old days are spent 
And my parents go into their own recluse 
My children will find a youthful strength 
And stammer with joy about
And why?
Because this mountain loves the way we move

I can feel it still
I can sense it through

    





More of Someone

The soul so crushed that she dared not dare to dream again.

Always saddens me indefinitely. 

Not because I wasn’t the avenue to her success, but because she wouldn’t try and be.

More of her former self around me.

    





More Than Sleep

Crows cackle at the edges of my eyelids 
They goad me into wanting sleep
But my mind, my mind 
Cares not for that most lesser need
Cause the sight of you to prove your existence 
Means more than rest to me

Means more than the rest to me

    





Morning BP

The sound of thunder
Long since heard
Off the grain of a Louisville slugger
Shakes the sleep from the eyes
The dawn from the air
And puts dangerous respect
Back into these young lives

    





Morning Experience

Cold caffeine 
Warm room
Rain outside my windowsill 

Quite chill
Somber tune 
Waterfall which turns to snow 

Hissing heat 
Radiates 
Truth until it’s known to me

That underneath 
Every tire 
Grinds the morning words to speak

    





Morning Feelings

Cold extremities 
Loud thoughts in quiet eyes  
With screeching questions underneath    
And squealing breaks       
On days like this; the sky should just go back to bed         
The sidewalks roll themselves up and hide

    





Morning Steps

Breathing smoke
Blowing mist 
Missed mornings passersby
And then
And then
A coffee hiss
A quiet whisp
Another day gone by

    





Mortality Is Being

Waiting doesn't stop with love
With responsibility, distraction, or understanding, no
We wait because we're human beings 
And the "being" demands we do so

    





Most Desires

Whatever your heart wants most in life...

The kind of things that you do not get
Which might just depress or even make sad

Whatever your heart can desire like this
It couldn’t possibly have

Which is why in the first place
Your blasted, bloomin, beggin heart
Most definitely wants but cannot have
Whatever it is it’s desires so bad

And you don’t have to quote me when I say that
Just go ahead and trace one of your heart-strings back
To the unwinding thing which you couldn’t have

    





Mostly

With all so near, so real and afraid
Of what could be nothing more than fear 

With your lovers' witness, do as you must
And then again not to hate yourself into desiring nonexistence

With humanity comes choice 
Mostly

    





Mother Nature's Headache

Tremendous pressure 
    Between two trees 
The pressures of autumn
    Which crinkles the fallen, forgotten, leaves 
    And cry beneath our feet
As we grind them slowly back to the earth 
    Unknowingly, she knows
    And drinks it all in
Like a summers mead

    





Motives

Let the future be your motivation 
Your drive to make it down the road 
Remain focused, remain persistent
Although the direction therein, you do not know

    





Mountain Top

Sometimes I wish I were like them
That I could see such alluring sights
And that in likeness shared with them 
I knew the fear of such trembling heights 

But then I’m reminded in my mind
Of my own mountains which arise 
With every dawn until the dusk 
It’s my own Everest I must climb

    





Mountain Veins

Crushing, beating, heart of the mountain
Encased in stone and rock enclosed
Ruby, emerald, sapphires, gold
But also bedrock veins of water
Running silently and cold

    





Moving and unmoved

Why is it in my nature to GO
And to never to stop 
And see the simple sun
Rise as it was meant to be

Unless it is my own idea that is 
Then instead, I'll stop for whatever suits me

Fancy that

    





Mr. Blue Eyes

Crystallized 
Is the place
You will find 
Within the blue
Within my eyes

    





Mr. Lighthouse

I view myself so sternly sometimes
As a tower standing tall above sands
Like a lighthouse alive on the shores of Lyme

When really I'm a swingset 
Noone plays on much more

Bright in the sun perhaps
But no less weathered by time

Regardless, I am kind of tall

    





Ms. Bennet

Wit is only as valuable as 
the appropriateness of mind which 
can begin to be, and thought of when
     For want of all moxie 
     For the stress of all scholars 
Implied

    





Ms. Mother Nature

Sometimes
All the time
You have to let a storm be a storm
As if you could stop it anyway

    





Musicbox

If my heart sings
   And I give you songs
   You'll know of such sounds
(in a quiet whisper)
   And in sounding out 
   Before so long
You'll know

    





My 51

The government has it's secrets 
And so do I 
We all are deep and in depth creatures 
Capable of living both very public 
And yet very private lives 

And yet every once and awhile in time 
I'm astounded by what is that I find
In my own life 

That I've been trying and far more confident 
In the standards which I set for myself
And now that I'm there without sense of self 
I no longer wish nor want to comply

    





My Entirety

Know not the rigidness of my eyes
Or the scent of my skin
As once did the picture on my face imply
For I am blameless in such regards 
And rightfully so 
For I have dedicated my entire self 
My entire life 
To the upholding of such high regards
For a person who I do not yet know  
That to me 
Is more pure than the new fallen of snow

    





My Favorites And Me

Gawd...
Frost is so good.

Gawd...
Cummings is so good.

Gawd...
Dunbar is so good.

Gawd...
Field is so good.

God, am I 
Any good? 

Gawd...

    





My feet know the only way to be

As I walk

Through the mountains of elevated responses to be

I look bout and feel, breathe in and see

A new outward being

Almost proud of, in me

Anew breath, a new earth

As I find newness

Where there was no patience in me

Previously

As I walk

    





My Heart Will Always Be Above You

Clear is not a dream to me
But a real aspiration 
No more desire to hide
But to be true though and through
And yet as complex as the turning summer sky embued 
I wake 
And am not without crashing storms embrace
Become free

    





My Hoodie

Time hasn't aged but grown together 
The considerate man and me
Because I haven't forgotten how to be sweet
Like <strong>My Hoodie</strong> floating round your shoulders
Swimming in it 
So large that you can wrap it around your knees
And warm as the arms beside my side
So it would be
For you I would keep even closer to me 
Than the meal which I like to prepare at night
Grilled cheese
So you would always be there by my side
In a place where you would never need
To fear the wandering of my mind
Or the inability of my eyes to see
Because I am all that I try
And to me you would most certainly be 
The only wonderment I would seek
To keep until the morning light

    





My Kind of Currency

Waiting for a silver dollar
Cold and true
In a world full of plastic cards untrue

    





myLIFE

My life is cloudy with a chance of smiles. Quiet with a propensity for lofi. 
And cold coffee warming like the mountain streams, basking in the summer sun. 

Look and see.

Just breathe and let me be.

    





My Linchpin

I am a man of little blocks
The world it tears me down
And when I'm broken on the floor
He picks me up
And gives me the support to build around

    





My Love, A Whisper In The Tree

Clearly 
You didn't get my message
And I trusted the trees 
So earnestly
To deliver it to you 
With speed
I'm afraid 
No such service exists

    





My Love In Central Park Alive

You are the radience inside my heart
The warmth within my December hue
The fire above my hearth
Is you 
As you're always burning, not the answer 
But the voice which softens in the dark
The winds which whisper in the snow laden park
And speaks of secret ivory keyswere alive
Theses always were
Is you

    





My Love of Years

Leave me bare as the trees
Born as the flowers
And blue as the summer sky and then
Watch the falling leaves devour the sidewalk clean
Until the ending rain beings to freeze
And falls like feathers
Again and again

    





My Memory of You, A Ghost

With an open hand I greet your ghost 
Set flowers by the curb aside 
And reach as I never reached in life 
Without regret or doubting eyes
I see you still 
Afraid to move away
From the dimming hallway light inside 
You are my favorite ghost by far 
Just as you were
Once alive

    





My mistress named Poetry

I understand 
You're jealous of my words
And greedy for my eyes and time
Which seeks to self aggrandize self
Which forgets our God and you alike

I see this now 
As clear as red flame
I can see what wishes you had in mind
And I, and I, still can care for these
But forgot not how to forget this time

Please understand, you are also in
My life

    





My New Obsession

Be like the wind 

You are the wind

You don't bend or break

No procedures are in place for you

Run up against it, flow around

Not out of strength 

But out of the hush

Out of the whistle

Out of sound

The wind is nothing

The wind is everything 

More than anything that could ever be built 

Because the wind will always be 

Around

In every lung and every city 

Whipping through the whistlers town

    





My Psalm

For months a struggle in vain I've been. Deliver me now my Lord.

Allow me to see for a moment beyond what this human heart thinks it adores.

Because I do not wish to continue like this, give me strength now to close this old creaking door.

Would you allow me to be, in my present need, at peace with this anxiousness, and within me no more?

    





Myself A Kite

The other day
I felt it suddenly
The well of rhymes within my chest
Depleting fast

Like the tides abound
My mind running out
And my words stretched out across the floor

At rest again
In bed again
A mind to start and test again
To beat the passion into a winded horse
I am running like a fumid man 

Without a muse 
What is a heart?
But a fickle clock to wind and twist 

And the temperamental time which takes
Forever still to announce amiss 

How powerless am I to keep
The well within a brimming full
For without a willingness within my chest
What is the wind in which I test?

Myself a kite
A puddle out
A museless man in I must invest

    





Myself In The Sky

Insignificant own
Comparable to that
Of many stars in the night sky 
Glimmering and I just one
Burning out slowly 
Like a distant light 
Ignite

    





My Sight Is From An Amphitheater

My eyes beneath a stage are they
Looking out into a world of audiences bewildered 
With a curtain brow not bent but known 
And a well lit masterpiece unwound 
Like spool and floss and threaded thought
I will weave these words around and down
Until they fall like leaves in September air
And you can finally see what was never mine

    





My Sindarin Love

At Last you are
  My heart of trees
    My walls of stone 
      My whisper in the Sindarin wind

Like a homely
  Gleaming
    Vein of oak
      Your limbs a door
        Ajar to an eternity 
          Uncloaked 

Standing 
  Naming Rivendell
    You are the sun
      My palace place
        Escape from Angbands hell

As dominion fades 
  Ere does the tide 
      So does the land
        East of Belfalas lie

The mountainous trees
  Begin and end
    With a swell of men 
      No more to tell 

At Last you are
  My heart of trees
    My stone since turned  
      My sacred dell

    





Mysteries

How does good love happen
?
It does

Good friends be found
?
They are

And goodness of character come to be
?
It's willed

Into existence 
Suddenly 
Know to but a few

There is always another universe 
Waiting to be found 
Within you

    





My The Self

I write more than I read
Because I'm not obsessed with them
Obviously
I'm an introvert 
And introverts are obsessed with who?
Exactly and not untrue 
That would be, me

    





My Writing Is

Experiential and sensation
Mixed with a desire to connect
A wonder regarding where its going
And very much
The fear that I'll forget
Scribble, scribble, scrawl it quick
The moment turns like a television set
Onward with the next

    





Nadadada

Nothing has [a] name
A place 
A feeling known as me
[In quarintine]

    





Natural, Beautiful

Beauty be it in the eye.

The same eye makes me wonder.

Both if and how your hair falls like this ... Most naturally.

And naturally so... If you even try?

    





Nature And Consciousness

Mindfulness, awareness
The pursuit of perfection indefinite

Though she may be
All which grows heavenly above the middle sea

I am the opposite of her
I am consciousness indefinitely

    





Nature, A Tanka

Be found in this ache
In the stretching of limbs and
The yearning of trees
In my own growing pains I 
Ache like the old wooden days 

(Nature)

    





Nature Need Not Think Itself Into Being

A fish can say to a frog
   "I am a tree
    And you a leaf"
But that doesn't make it so
In truth or shade 
Midst nature and in light
They were designed as neither such to be
On top of which 
It's different languages they speak

    





Natures Grasp

With horizons like shoulders
Stands the image of the self
In the self-perceived mind 

Until called like ringing
The mountains asleep
Undisturbed in dew and time

So the woodsman knows and is awake 
To the truest of nature
The societal eyes

And at the feeling of ever 
Need it depart

He flies 

Into the mountains to live a life spent alive

    





Necessities of A Limited Life

There is willingness 
And there is want
And the lack thereof, one from the other
Is noticeable 
A sign of impending doom 
And gloom 
And if so, you’d best not try
You'd best not move lest you fail to pass
The test of passing time

    





Need and needed

There is no shame

In needing something 

So much as there is

The disappointment when

You discover that your something

Will never be needed

    





Neither Of Nor Above

I am neither of them nor above them. 
Though I do stand here looking out. 

I am separate. 
I am me. 
As much as you can ever be you, 
And I have ever been me.

For it is in this place where we become we. 
The investors, 
The collectors, 
And the testing who test the testers. 

We are us and they are them. 
And yet the youth of today and tomorrow so rarely see, 
That the educated and the un are all the same, 
Just like you and me.

We all are people, 
And to each his or her own. 
We each try and find our own way to flee from it all, 
Above it all.
 
Outward and upward. 
In such a world, 
And in such words as you will find here, 
Is where you will always find someone like me. 

Neither of nor above. 
Yet ever present,
Always yearning to be free.

    





Never Aware (of self)

Does the ocean know where its own heart is? 
Or the sand their numbers?
Or the rain its downfall?
No, not at all
It doesn't think of such things at all

    





Never Ending Rain

With a rain like this
That would never stop
I'd wish it not over
Again and again
That way I wouldn't have to face the sunshine
Let alone call it mine
When this need for a new life of mine
Must begin

    





Never In Between

When you write
Write for no one
Or for someone
Never in between

    





Never In The Present, Me

Unaware of my own walking
Feet are numb though midday may be
Forever wandering and talking
About the sunshine nothingness of time
And I am witness to this madness 
My farsight focused, nearsight blind

    





Never Lie

The trick is not a trick at all
     Of self
           Of other
                 Of wanton desire
But in thIs and therein the I
Never be what err you cannot 
And never have a reason to lie

    





Never We

Not of wind
Or of wills
Or of ways to be 
Though we spoke of truth
And of the tombs of Kings 
Most gallantly
No
The words were never recognized
As they flowed so freely from within
To peak the howling wind which we both liked to describe
The past, and there, therein

    





New Mexico Reservoir

Spin me around in the desert and see
If I'm upset by these 
Dry surrounding beings

And the answer is this
As you trail kick the dust 
And move away from me

So I shout out loud
In a fading barrage 

"How can I be?!?!"
When there's just so much water and word
Following currents within me

I will not die when I'm like this
Let alone perspire

    





New York Has The Best Mountains

Frightful in the Catskills
   There is fearless my heart beating
Long and slow 
   In leather strips and sacred meadows 
With berries past and present, stew
   And heavy dew mornings on the eyes 
   These sunlit mists which often persist 
Making heads turn with every thought to sway  
   Dear mountain dream 
   From which I always awake 
   Cold and alone in a neighboring state 
Please don't take your love away 

New York Has The Best Mountains

    





Next To Me

I close my eyes and pretend she's here
Wrapped up in my anxious arms
As the future which I hold most dear
Awaits elsewhere

And I am left alone to speak
And practice reciting the many things
Which one day she
Will want to know and about me

Quietly and patiently 
I remind myself of all that's been
Of all I've tasted in this life
The bitter and the sweet

And slowly as I edge towards sleep
I am reminded with closing eyes
That in this moment were not meant to be
Together until she's next to me

    





No Cloud Is Ever Exactly As Remembered

The mind seeks to be
To express its worth
In metaphor and homily

And yet no cloudy day remains alive
Within your mind

As memories grey and overcast 
Like a visionary dream once passed

You are awake
And yet your eyes
Are only aware of this present take
On life lived alive

No voice is meant to learn such things
Or to recognize these passing clouds
Which have long since passed you by

No cloud is ever exactly as remembered within your mind

    





No Human Drink Eternal

At the bottom of every cup
Their is either 
Acceptance or ignorance 
Loss or desire
For more or less knowing
There is thirst in every human throat
For the drink of mind which will return
For some a nothing ounce 
For others all which the senses can possibly remeber and inspire 
With fire, and water, and heart to beat
No drink lasts by drink
Or by slow plastic perspire

    





No, I Think Not

Does quality know that it's quality?

Does a thoroughbred know it's a winner? 

Do the chance-less still stand, for a chance at all?

Can the redeemed ever not know their redeemer? 

Though you cast all your peals before swine, do they care?

Will we think fore we trample our friends?

Can you count all the birds in the bushes as if caged?

Just as man counts the days till the end?

    





Nomadic Thinker, Wishing

I don't fear you
So much as I do 
My me as a being
Preoccupied with evicted thoughts 
A homeless mind
Is mine 
I see

Would you grant me some of your spare thoughts, please?

    





No More Than Ash

I don't have ghosts
Or believe in memories
As an empty closet holds no sway
The past being no more than ash
With a breath to breathe it away

    





No one is someone I’ve yet to know

The most distant hope
Of mine
Is you 
...
And that 
When she turns around
No one is someone I’ve yet to know
!
Who is looking for me
As I am looking at you
?

    





Nope, Just The Wind (;

Your voice
An echo in my atmosphere 
I thought I caught it once
In fast descent one summers night
And I thought and thought
That it could be you 
Since the wind was never so loud in voice 
So alive as that
Since you always did have 
That particular shine within snowy eyes
But no
Not this time

    





Nopologetic

Sorry about the way I fall       
  how mortality fades me     
through and with.          
Inevitably it's this       
And this is this.       
In you and calling
Me out so much 
 Not seeing is. 
To me         
a true       
being.   
(you)

    





Not All Is Blue

It’s between the veins of blue and gray 
Where the secrets hide
You’ll have to look awfully close to see
The pieces therein  
Within my eyes

    





Not A Morning Person

A heavy night 
Caves in my chest
Collapses me like underground sound

And in falling this
Echo feels no duress 
But a resounding weight profound compounds 

Like crushed earth I am 
In the morning noise

    





Not A Morning Person This

In the mornings 
The mirror stares at me
In awe and wonder 
Miraculously knowing more than beans 
Will be needed 
To generate the articulate out of this insufficient me

    





Note For The Dejected Girl

It doesn't matter how sweet I am, or how kind I feel that I have to be. All that really matters to me is you, and how based on me you will perceive,

The other men, the other shoes, the many soles slowly passing by. The kind of guys which you might keep, and even ultimately try. 

But I hope you see what is truly weak, after sharing such strong arms as these. I hold you now, but not in hand. I hold you still in great esteem. 

If only you would esteem yourself, you'd walk on surer, more stable feet. Not into the arms of a tragedy, but into the future which you deserve. Holding tight to a steadier hand than me.

    





Notes

These notes were just abandoned pages, until I took them in and they adopted my thoughts. My name as their own.

    





Not furious... She was... Wild!

You were a fourth born, snow-born, breeze 
Wild as the first sight of a western scene 
And I was surprised, by the furious snow 
As I didn’t expect you so early that Fall

    





Nothingness of Mind

I dare you
    To sit or stand
    To draw or write
    To paint or wrong
    To not be so **** polite
    To force or feel
    To be without phone
    To stand in rain
    To not be so alone 
I dare you again
I dare you alive
I dare you once more
    To stop thinking about it
I dare you to try

    





Not Running From Self

The hardest part of a mirror in mind
Is not the seeing
It's the not running

    





Not Today

What do we say
To a god of death
Perched precariously high 
Upon this rocky way?

Do we walk
Or flee or fight?

Either way
With the spit in its eye 
We say not today
Not today

    





Not Your Name (but)

Never give a man of words
The silent time to fly a plane
As he'll take off and write your character in the sky

    





Oak

Greet me by morning
Turn my back and walk away
By the end of each night returning
And with the dawn departure, again
You remain here even when I try and turn
You repeat your glances longingly and sway

You are my oak
And I am thankful

    





Oak And Twine

To be alone is no crime
To be strong like oak
Or to spin like the baler and his twine 
Because to be molded is to wait to be broken
Apart by the falling folds of time
To be falling out beside yourself 
That is a shame but not a crime

    





Observing A Vice

The struggles and vices of another.
Are no less genuine to them, than you are to your own.

For we all have scars, and struggles, and little selfish lies.

The kind of thoughts that say that THIS or THAT or HE or SHE...will satisfy.

When they will not. And you know it.

    





Ocean Floor

Though the full weight of the oceans breast
Should crash down upon me
To crush my bones and burst my chest
I will not forsake the name sound of my God
I will not

    





Ocean Skies A Tanka (S7)

No ocean neath falls
Or sand drops ere out of place
Beneath the cresting
Turning waves inadequate
All is home in tidal place

    





Ocean Waves Don't Come From You

No matter how much you thrash
Or fight with believing 
The moment that you think
That either beginning or the act 
Of swimming, will save you
You cease to see the reason behind seeing
Behind being
And the ocean

    





October Clouds

Dark clouds call my name 

With an honest voice 
And a unified pattern of pattering sounds
Which hum like rain
And crash upon my shoulders 
In this slumping chair of arching down

I do not respond

    





October Day

Make all 20,000 
breaths you take
Today be the best
you could ever be

For tomorrow is left
yesterday is death
and righr now
you are where you're meant to be

    





October Eyes

My eyes cry out
My heart winds down
And all that's left to see is sky
This universe waiting to be explored
Lies just behind

    





October Friends

Real friends dont just let you be 
(the most flawed version of yourself)
They look beyond
They tolerate and encourage 
They really understand 
They see

    





October Haiku

The wishful dream of 
Someone to be near is what
I answer when asked

    





October Irony

It's not even funny
Though I'd like to laugh
At such a bright sunshining irony
Which glows like orange leaves at noon
And stays like casting skys of over
Until the day is at an end
I'll know and laugh overly
Almost glowingly 
With you

    





October Life

For some people 
Life just happens

They wake up next to their future and find
That they're already living it, already in it

And then there's me
And my ability to not even begin it

    





October Paths

I need new paths —
My feet in love,
They walk more willingly
Than any of these strangers know

And yet in going
There is only this,
Such willingness resolved to be
And so — with hope I go

    





October Set

We work to craft and build our being
So that being us is not a bore 
A chore or miserable existence 
Where we do not at least have
The smallest hope of being free

Set

    





October Thought

I have lost the thought
Which once was mine
And in remembering it
Cant 
Even begin to describe 
How frustrating it is
To live and not find

At least what I thought once was mine

    





October Time

Letting the years pass by
Is not a matter of choice
But a matter of being 
Be it conscious or unconsciously 
Done
But equally, we are all undone

    





October Waters

I am as unsettled
As a stretch of running water 
Ever could be and seemingly ever (is)

Always moving
Never forward
Seemingly

These thoughts are but

    





Oddly Cold

If feelings were a cold
I'd send you out into the dead of winter
Just to wish for the chance to catch
And whisk you back to well

    





Oddly Colorful

Raspberry skies
Peek out from behind
Foamy - dreamless - clouds
And whisper in
Crafting visions out
Of men and their minds
And the light which captivates 
All of the eyes who try

    





Oddly Honest

Tell all the must-dos of your life, for just a moment, hold your p*ss. There's no snow in September anyways, and one more such afternoon will not be missed. In the scheming grandeur of nothingness.

    





Oddly Intimate

Having is not having
And nothing exists
When can be more than something 

Shared

    





Oddly Pointed

I get so busy pursuing, not people, the ideal. That I forget to breath, forget to see, hyperforgetting what is real. 

Would you help me remember?

    





Oddly Simplistic

Once you are what you once set out to become? Who will you be?

    





Oddly Spring

I am reeds
neath green turned leaves
which strain to catch 
the whispers of the wind which pass
as fervently as they speak

and to noone at all
I listen

    





Oddly Tough

This neverending battle never fails to fight it's way through every Sunday, every smile, every sickness, and every catered ad. 

It goes on and on like the nothing long, and the day which ends only to begin again.

I am haunted by windows.

    





Oddly True

Life is tearing yourself down
Every
Day
And building yourself up
In a better, stronger, image
Not of self
But of selflessness

    





Oddly Up

When is not a doubt 
If life living is without
A sense of purpose
Much like a sky without stars
Or a moon without its shine

Would you look up into eyes and see
All that could be
And is within
?

    





Ode To London Below

Did you know?

That those shimmering shining reflective lines
Are from the deepest puddles man has yet to know?

And yet we call them ghosts
Out of limelight fear
Not of London made
But no less below

For beneath every living thing there is this
A shadow

    





Of all the people I wish to know...

I don't know why...

The moon in its endearing way
Encircles us on breathless string along 
Or why the tides cry ill each night
Only to be in court for the hearing at dawn 

The rushing lawns of browning green
Or why they need a trim to fall
Or the crisping leaves of sweeping scenes
And why they whisper around me at all 

The rock and stone the smoothing ore
Beneath waters rushing to and fro
No crackling snow left sparks alive
No mountain stream running by itself alone 

But out of all of these things which I do not know
Of what and why and whethering seems
Like the lines of growing seeds to sow
Why it's your eyes behind that I wish to know 

I don't.

    





Of Masterpiece And Memory

The old names that I used to know
Roll out no more, like curtains old
Like a theatre in the lesser days
When more was sung in older ways

As I sit here in the mirror room
With lenses quiet as a tomb
Just to think of names I once had seen
Alive, a thread, in poetry seems

Would'ya close the curtain, lock the doors?
And stoke the candles inside no more?
Because the poets heart is quiet when
He life is brightest in the eyes of men

So be it showmanship deceived
Would you show me the name of a friend indeed?
And I'll read and read until bygone age
Until all the lenses have passed away 

And the stars become the only screen
Where the heights of poetry 
And the shallow depths of the human soul 
Can be ere seen

For as the old names that I used to know
Quietly pass away 
Only words remain like fallen snow
In the masterpiece of a city day

    





Of Mine, Of Mind

Take me away from my own mind
I cannot stand
Another second
Another instance of time
Spent sitting inside  
The same old thoughts and lines 
Of mine
Of mind

    





Of Music And Mind

New songs 
are like lovers 
once newly discovered.

When you find them
you'll loop them 
and listen unendingly. 

Thinking that the newness 
they provide
is what perfectly defines
your life as it is.

Yet knowing all along
in the back of your mind
that such feelings wont last
once a few days have past
and the love which you felt 
is no more playing back

Yet we loop in our minds 
doing no more to define
the true meaning of presence 
in another person's life. 

Because all feelings will fade
like the end of all days 
and Martin Luther was right 
when he proclaimed God remains

    





Of Parenthood

And then suddenly
Your own faculties 
In addition, to 
The most incredible teaching, un
Are pull apart by time
And designated by others, only 
Until such freedom re-arrives
At the turning of adulthood tides
And even then still
You too must return, suddenly

    





Old Addiction

You’re the drug I see from an old distance 
A smile that I cannot hold 

How I wish and wish 
And wish and wish
And grow older 

Sipping on cups of memories 
Which I thought I'd emptied long ago

    





Old Age

Closet
Mirror 
Candlestick 
Creek in the floor 
River in her eyes
Fear most definitely is this

    





Ominous

I am thunder
I am lightning
I am a length of the Willow whip in the wind
Ever cracking in the air and striking 
Precariously 
That’s how I like to live 
When I’m on point 
And on the edge 
No one can withstand the imminence 
The ultimate outcome
When I assume this stance 
Ask anyone of my dominance 
And they’ll assure you of such prominence 
Because when I unchained myself 
The thunder rolls 
And the strike looms
Ominously

    





On A Hillside (A Tanka)

Black willow rises
Across a hill beside Me
Underlaid burden
Spent no more a tragic be 
Than in this being up grown

    





Once More Alive

In this prominence
Om·ni·pres·ence
On a cathedral I stand 
Beneath the oceans breath 
And fly without thinking of these stars 
Which are but fireflies in the meadow around
I am bigger than galaxies
Older than thoughts 
And more aware of being than we've ever been

    





Once Shared

You lead my ears to water
Thirsty once forever be
For it is May and I intend 
To make this music mine to me 

Forever yours
So is my artist
To will his will 
Will ever be

For this exists 
In both our minds 
In memories mixed
With solidarity

    





Once Touched By Hands Most Fair

Paper isn't paper
It's air
And flowers become like seraph clouds
Once plucked from daisy skies 
When you are in the hills of mind
And bring yourself to me in pieces 
Like the breath of summer laid bare
You are undoubtedly my present air

    





On Days Like This

Potsu says what cannot be seen
But what can easily be felt by those around
Resting just in pace
Within the same coffee shop as me

    





One Kiss

Am I dreaming again?
I don't honestly know.
With my tall frame a twist,
And you on your toes.

That one kiss shattered time,
And yet held it in place.
These old light posts remain,
Having witnessed embrace.

Not another in sight, 
To have seen what we'd see.
Your lips resting on mine, 
Beneath wood and the green. 

In that moment my friend,
The earth did cease to spin,
In that moment it held,
And I kissed her again.

    





One Of A Certain Kind

I am the rolled up sleeves before it's socially acceptable.  Before 3:00. 
I am the rooftop climber and the moonlight gazer.  Swinging in the bitter wind. 
I am the patient one.  The tag along.  Often kind but on my own.
And always off in my own mind. 
Completely different.  And yet the same. 
I am one.  </em>*One of a certain kind.

    





One Of Five

So many wonder, so few will find. The ring which you threw into the river knowingly. With the currents, truth will never un, but wind.

Until the sea's remind.

    





One The Same In Song

It’s been too long
since in findings found.
I lost myself in words like leaves
In waving metaphor and euphoric breeze 

It’s been too long now for even me
to say that I can still smell the trees, 
and live like aspen beings tall and young. 
It's been so very long now since our song's been sung. 

Like an echo it
reverberates across water mists.

Like a chorus I 
am no longer left ununified or in wanderings lost.

No the sky,
we were meant to sing songs such as these
You and I.

    





Only One Altar

One God is 
E n o u g h 
In my life
I do not 
Wish to worship
Her as well

    





only today

tomorrow, Lord knows what I may become
but today I am all vibrance and fur
all electric fuzz and fire and fountains
stroke daringly, me, and see for yourself
the life

    





Only Yourself At The End

Inevitability and time are plagues 
On the human soul, the psyche, the mind
Leeches leech
And ticks borough 
But time and inevitability weave 
And sow so much of nothingness
That without (God)
There is no now

    





On Plane To Austin

Think of what you want the most 
To share with another human being 
And if you can’t envision your lover there
Simply being</em>
It will never be</em> so

    





On Shelves

When I look at all of their accomplishments 
I see me
I see the potential I could be
The time inside therein intertwined 
Most strenuously 
And yet
I know my motives are not pure
And so I wait
For calling to be 
On a shelf because 
Selfishness will not endure
But a calling will last for forever

    





On The Pedestal

When you look at the body, 
        you can see his work.

And when you investigate your own work, 
                you should see his work.

And if you can see nothing else, 
                        in the kindness, see worth.

And when you see the next failure, 
                                 see him quietly at work. 

Because we have no room for ego next to him. 
                                         And nothing is small enough to stand beside.

    





On Top Of The Earth

Stand with me on the top of the Earth, 
Look down into the valley of History. 
See both the young man I always was, 
And the young man I will always be. 

Should I ever fall or quietly break, 
Or even be thought to have ran away.
Stand here and be among the trees,
Look down on the earth and you'll see me.

    





Open, Close

Lingering at a window
Keeps the world at bay
No more 
Than a miniature globe on a downward *****
Close the window 
Slip away

    





Open Night (second love)

We love the night
Because she holds no secret stars
Or fears no moonlit falling out

    





Open Skies, Open Heart

The rain falls heavy on my heart
Directly and fervently
With a subtle patter to be heard in part

Reflecting only as tired can be
In being our separate, you and me
We are bound by these, such worlds apart

With ribs thrown open like lighthouse doors
And parted seas, as shallow as these
Such broken chances leave their marks

In pouring self out ever slow, in all these ways
The rain, it falls heavily every day
My life is kept from you apart

    





OPPOSING

My bones are strong 
my back straight enough to keep .
If anything I do not 
need any more structure in me .
I need 
            opposite . The

    





Oregon Reflection

Sometimes you walk out of this world
And into another, full of complacency.
Where all of your hopes and dreams from before,
Are revealed to be, the excuse. 
The escape from present just to mentally be,
Wherever you were,
Just so long as you were free.
Free that is, from the here and now.

    





Original Thought

These words 
 Are neither alone
  Nor my own

Having found their way from eyes to ears
 From ears to mouth 
  And down

No thought original 
 Ought to be originally found
   When it comes to expression out

We speak
 And what we think to be our own
  Is found

    





Orion In The Sky

Orion stirs my soul to write
To look into the eyes of the sky and see
To hear the distant howling moon 
To reach beyond the silhouetted trees
Until I stand above all this
On either side of the pinnacle roof
Oh yes, like you
I've climbed my whole life to reach this height
To stare back into the stars anew
How you look at him, would look at me? 
Orion in the sky so high
Though no man is a burning star
But a constellation
For he is connected to the flickering flame
Which burns for you

Endlessly...
With perception ever turning through

    





Orr Canoe

Like a paddle lean
Cut the water with yourself
And dig it deep as I have

That way you may not forget yourself
Within this tidal swirl 
The wave of life and the currents underneath

    





Ounce

A tiny bit of me
Still believes 
In the ounceless weight 
Of our slowly dying dream
Falling like the stars
Occasionally in mind and eyes

    





Our Feet Forever Apart Again

Your heart a grey sky scenic quaint
My brushes too cold unable to touch
Your fragrant sky now dark as storms 
With stars like broken glass finely crushed 

And I, and I, a dusty grain
In of a field of sandy wishes warm 
Found nothing but a sharp memory pain
In the heel of my mind there sticks your thorn 

Like tress unborn of acorn hopes 
And buried wishes beneath dead stones 
There rise and fall in the mind of see
Having since seen my dawning home

 Peaking above the wavering trees 
There our path beneath ever separates 
And in turning hearts now etched in grey 
Sketched out an open talk 

Just to say that this is one of the many places
Though we once traversed, we will not walk

    





Our Future Ceilings

The wood and stone and plaster we will share
Is unknown to me at present time
But like the stars we will look up at them
And ponder all that was here before
And the time that's been left behind

    





Our Tanka

She is starlight cold
The kind which radiates me
And I am mere glass
Formed by timeless sandy days
And iridescent are we

    





Outgrowing A House

A home is not HOME
Unless you choose it to be
Even if you had
At one point in time
You must again
Or it's just another USE TO BE

    





Out Of This World

It doesn't hurt
To not be valued
By those who do not know your worth

No...

What hurts is when the human heart
Desires the starlight
Beyond its own earth

    





Outreacher

When the silence grips the arm at length
After a great outreach of heart

Take hold of mind, letting go of hand
Hoping it will not longingly stay

And all a young man can do is not think
Not think about it and pray

    





Outside

So confident when signing up for it. 
So comfortable once in.
So awkward when outside the door. 
Am I the me who wants to be in?

    





Over And In Time

Trees over rivers 
Dew over blades
Water over gravel beds
Warm clouds rain over Western plains
And I
Trust in the inevitable over the doubt
Seek courage over the fearful flame
And think over and over abundantly
Yet over that in time I will be
Or so I proclaim

    





Overcome

It's not how quick your feet are
Or how fast you can run in an attempt to fly

It's none of THAT and all of THIS
How you fall with the imperfections of each inevitable try

I'll tell you what it is, IT IS, right in front of you
In the face of the breath which has yet to come

It has nothing to do with how many times your feet may falter
When you fail to fly

But how quickly you can defy and overcome 
Which defines the true heart inside

    





Overflow

I'm so full right now so very warm
Like a coffee cup overflowing with ideas 
I cannot wait to be off this road 
I cannot wait to be onward with this journey 
To create again and to let my words flow 
Outward and into the microphone
How I cannot help but overflow 
When the questions stored up inside my mind
May be answered so I might finally know 
That is why I actually wish to overflow
So that in time I might just know

    





Over Your Head

As if anything you say or do could impact me 
Dear innocent girl 
You keep your puddles 
And I’ll be happy 
Especially if you ever decide to swim with me in the sea

    





Oxygen To Burn

With heavy parchment and parted ink, 
My pen calls out to your wandering mind. 

Breathing in the dark of night, 
Your oxygen keeps me alive.

Like a fire burning in the dark, 
I cut the heavy fog of time. 

If only with purpose would beat my heart, 
Your oxygen would keep me alive.

Before our dawn could even start, 
We reach the end of this cotton line.

Although in time we're torn apart, 
Your oxygen keeps me alive.

Like a fleeting wisp you were to me, 
Like a curl of smoke from a bed of pine.

Yet until this letter I complete, 
Your oxygen will keep me alive.

    





Pace Yourself

Who is this?
The way that is
Straight and true
Once born
And yet
To walk this way
In a hurried day
I desire that speed
No more

    





Painted Words Between Distant Mailboxes

You strengthen me
Stretch me tall in fond pursuit 
And call my waking trees to move with subtle hints 

Familiar as the folding sound 
Between quiet rustling parchment leaves 
Becoming new our newest sounds as an inkwell drawn 

Like a sunlit jewel your dulcet glow 
Is stumbling down a penciled path of painted memory 
Colored by every season anew with the hues of you 

Don’t cry when I am no more seen, my felicity
It was always and with you in mind 
That you made me want to try

    





Paper Fires, Burning Letters

The other day
A match struck my roughness
And anxiousness took me to be freed by fire 
As I burned away all of your rusted memories
Which'd been stored for yet another day
Which turned out to be today
In ashes your words
Cast, burn and floating away

    





Parchment

Paper 
Yearns for the trees
No more than I
A humble man
Yearn for the pride of my prior youth 
For once you have begun
You can always begin again
In some respects 

Isn’t that write?

    





Parents

It's not that I understand eternity now. 
The luminescence of the heart and soul. 
I do not. 
No.
Only now do I understand the complexity of it all. 
The size and scale of the scope and whole. 
And therein also my tiny this. 
My role in the departure of these lives old.

    





Passing Thoughts

My mind is flint
My tongue the tinder
A spark that is
Just let me die

These were the passing thoughts of mine

    





Pass Me By Gentle Time

I can feel the light on my own skin, soaking into the eyes and bouncing off the cream-colored walls of old. The light, evaporating into the hours as if planned to pass gently by. And then within them accordingly. So also am I.

    





Patience, Family

With growing mask 
And similar shadows
A quick response
To light, to shrink
Instead remain
Both steady and calm 
With outstretched hands
And don't forget 
That always with each end
Comes ending ways
And that these present days
Are such moments but a single blink

    





Patience Is We

Patience is no freer than sky
No further than breath from within you breathe 
No more mapped than oceans collected cold 
And yet warmer than the touch of summery springtime bold 

Patience is cost
Patience is free
Patience is you, still
Waiting for me

    





Patiences As A Matter Of Pride

I cannot satisfy myself with flowers
Out of fear of never seeing the trees
Swim in puddles
When I know that I ought to dance in the ocean
Selfishly, I'm not sorry now
Though I may once have been
If you are niether as tall or as deep as these
But I want no wattage less than sunshine
No new life born of less than me
You will learn this quickly, perhaps
That I am a proud and patient sort of being

    





Peaceful Feet

Peace, quiet.

Wash over me and see these feet -

Not own but owned by others 

With joy-filled steps of contentment - leave 

And I 

Finding nothing but thoughts abound

And a will within to stay sitting down 

Feel not their need as is not my need 

And I - having all which I could want at hand

Am alone at last in me

I'm free

    





Peaks

That horizon
It would've been beautiful 
To climb and peek
At its mountain peeks
And at the top to see
All of the breathless heights 
Which it would've held

But instead
In the middle of the week
I wed

    





Peaks And Valleys

No happy man ever said to me
"Because I'm happy it will always be so"</em>
For in reality
Without the highest of highs and the valleys below to balance them out
How else are we to take in the sight or learn to see?
Without first having discovered both the lie and the mystery
Within such peaks and valleys
The highs and lows
The mountains and holes.

    





Pendulum

A pendulum, rocking to the heartbeat of eternity 
In time, in tune, in step with the world
Inside of the footprint of this city street 

Like a whisper in the passing wind
Or a whistle nearby yet unseen
Striding forward with a massive force
Unstoppable as the former me 

This is the essence of my own demise
And the love which grew too strong and too quickly 
In order to keep my song alive

And yet through this I've become an entity 
So I will rock for eternity, back and forth atop the hill
And also in the flatlands in the east
Where the whispers were first heard to me

    





Pen &amp; Quell

We remember heartache for a spell 
Not because of the significance of those who have cast us off
But because it's the brightest color red 
On the first of many canvases 
That is until 
The permanence of togetherness 
Bring together both pen and quell

    





Peppermint Mocha Tanka

Raptures here in such 
Open mouths, discussions sweet
As peppermint dreams,
Therein began still sipping
Less this noisy unknowing

    





Perfectly Natural

In the clutches of envy, or judgement, or denial
With eyes turned outward at another life 
Don’t hide when the inkwell turns up dry 
But accept the death which comes to life 
And lets you pass by this windowed world

Fly
Fly into the perfectly natural
Die

    





Perhaps

Perhaps* 
     One day
         It will be 
            Like this
                Or be like that 
                    One day
                        *Perhaps

    





Perhaps Maybe?

Searching for the truest of words
The quest of me
Is a sermon for an audience of one
Or two perhaps?
Maybe

    





Perhaps This Road

Signing up for this certain road
Foreseeable or not 
Be it windingly long, or deafeningly smooth
Makes no difference to me
Because to get to the end of it
To the end of it all 
And to drive on like this 
Is to get to be with, and be beside you

    





Permitting Self

Sometimes to lose is to find
     It's true

But sometimes
     You cannot allow yourself to live
          (At least as you'd like)

Until you stop
     Pause 
          Go back 
               And rewind

    





Personal

Learning to be selfish
Unlearning how to think
Aware of the ocean bottom fear
I am not 
But still in my mind
And steady my will
Lord strengthen my prayer
My resolve
My being

    





Personal, Ethereal, Song and Sight

Someday I'll play this song for you
Someplace where only you will hear
And only we will see
Appearing suddenly as a mountain fog in the morning Spring
And you'll know the breadth of my thought breathed for you
The gifts I once created too
Long before we were we

    





Perspective

When the inevitably of the morning wakes
And anger insues
At the realization that life did take
Just to catch yourself on another day
That is when you need most to praise
Since all has being has been created
Thorns and all
In a beautiful way

    





Persuasion, A Wentworth

I'm not at sea
We're not at war
At all more happy about what's been
The ships which set sail over again
On the same old breath of tired wind 

I'm a man inland 
And as we once were here 
So long ago before we stood 
Watching the storm creep in 
Sweeping softly over limestone cliffs

And with this I remember
Like the clear day fore Michaelmas
Before the storm sets in
When we were back then

Again

    





Petals

Sometimes feeling
Like a flower unfolding 

Open to any passing bee
Overcaring and all giving of pollen 
Of any wanting or for wanters flying by

I avail myself
Until I am tired and empty

    





Peter Pan

Eventually you forget how to escape
To open the door at the back of your mind
And walk on though it
Into the new
And that is why we should value our innocence 
And our children in such a way as we do

    





Phenomenal Distractions

Having children of my own, somewhere, someday.
Will be to me, the most phenomenal distraction from self which could ever be...

    





Photo Shoots

Shooting spree 
Fatal none
(that I know)
The camera man once me

    





Pine Needles

This is the path before my feet
Which I'd like to share

The wet grass, the grey clouds, the pine trees</em>
Poking the sky to run their fingers through its hair 

Surrounded by the kind of limbs which always thrive
But do not necessarily care, about a man's feelings 

How they have listened</em> to me throughout the years
Until my voice is my own in mind

How their echos</em> and their shadows</em>, have carried me in the past 
When I was there, and had more weight to bare

But not this time, which is exactly why 
I hope you could see both here</em> and there</em> 

Beside the talking pines</em> forever
How I hope to walk, without care 

I'd describe it for you if you'd ask me 
*With a piney laughter in the air

    





Ping Me

Your emotion isn't poetry
But your poetry should be an emote

    





Pity The Famous Man

The worst illness available to man
Is not a fever of sorts
But fame 
And the expectations stored within 
That he has been solved
That he has been called by his true name
Which, ironically 
Is never true at all 

Because it's better to live in a house of wood 
It's better to build without a name inscribed 
Than to be called by all
And requested at all hours of the night  
Because what then becomes of life?
When you suddenly have 
All of that which you have wished for?

    





Pity The Foolish Tongue

When they curse and cry and weep and wail 
When they try and throw you down like a stone 
Don’t sink or slurk, but float 
And that alone will be enough, to know

    





Pizza

We see the results
Not of what we want
But of what we do 

In the quiet hour when instead of reassurance 
Our heart wants pizza
And we are in need of all things renewed

    





Plastic Ball Haiku

This plastic fire burns
Into a melted mixed bag
Of ***** and strikeouts

    





PLATFORM

When God
Reaches down
And wraps your voice
Your arm, your mind 
In a gifted shroud 
Nobody cares about your small, petty, human politics stupid 
Just go out and wow the crowd

    





Play The Game

You can't play a game of matters of the heart,
If your heart isn't available to be had.

    





Please Don’t Resuscitate Us

Would it be rude of me?
At such a far proximity
To not breathe breath back into our being?
 
Cold and quiet as the morning
Laying still like the undisturbed sheets
Windowless without sense or feeling
 
Would you consider it mean?
If I chose to not let this proud chest beat?
And collapse in a time like the hills into a cavity
 
Just as riverous words cuts the valley sharp
And the tongue softens both pen and quill
How rude would it be if I didn’t care about our relationship lying still?

    





Please &amp; Thank You

No monument of me be made
Or carving placed once I am gone
But please instead
Let my borrowed words be but a memory of mine
And if you should find yourself compelled by them
And must appreciate them based on a similarity of mind
Letit be done so, quickly, quietly, personally
Don't ***** out a single stanza in the name of me
Thank you
I'd appreciate it most greatly

    





Plotted Path

Lay me out like tiles on a floor
Thrown down as if my order didn't matter
When really I am, the plan is me
A succinctly styled corridor
A path to walk down beneath the feet

    





Poetic Rivers Underneath

Poetry is
The earth we see
When its tumultuous and green

And syllables 
Are the rivers
Carving out valleys deep beneath

    





Poetry A River

Someday someone
In passing or in present
Will strike this stone with such a force
That the stream beneath will be revealed

And finally flowing
Slowing in a southern fashion growing
My river will be born

But not anew

    





Poetry For The Three A.M. Soul

In the stillness after all the distractions 
Fade into the fading air 

The hope of you
It dawns on me 
Is it there to last
And in the darkness 
Soften this once lonesome stare

All evenings end where the morning begins
And I am there

    





Poet-Tree

After writing like this for many years 
As a poet-try
You cannot help but grow a good bit
Like a poet-tree

    





Poisonous Passivity

A passive mouth 
Should not be able to stand 
On solid ground

In fact it never will
Know such a foundation

So long as passivity and poison 
Anger and predisposition
Line a tiny row of fragile teeth 

I will not know
Let alone why it bites

    





Politics

Chemical, the fluctuation of quiet in the night. 
And yet, the dawning of the agenda reveals no radiant Dawn. 
No truth revealed, just another dogged fight.

    





Portrait By The Sea

She is a portrait in my mind 
A canvas of flesh and blood 
With an ink stain upon her chest
Where her heart still beats steadily 
He life turning like the ocean
Her eyes as stead as the water underneath 
She is a portrait and yet a friend of me
And by the sea she will always be

    





Posterior

That is the glorious peeking dawn
Youthful flowers in a denim vase
Pure beauty beneath, behind the face

    





Pounding Heart (third love)

We love the heart
For how it beats aloud
For none to see and only one to hear

    





Pouring Down

This day is like the pouring rain, heavy falling and hard to swallow. 
Dark as the memory of an old embrace, 
Cold and mellow, like the cousin of a summer day. 

Yet within this rain we are unchanged, just not the same. 
I see the water as it cascades, 
And floods the streets, to wipe the dogged dirt away. 

It’s in my ears, it's on my mind, like a booming sigh. 
The raindrops on the soggy ground. 
Flooded I am washed away, but not far enough to leave this town.

    





Pouring In And Out

Eventually you'll find
That after every doubt and waining fear
Has been stripped away
That time is all and good for your soul
And that jazz is just good coffee for your ears

    





Pouring Out And In

It's like pouring water down a well
To find someone
To hold within
Your darkest thoughts to secrets tell

Because if they listen
(And there's no guarantee they will) 

Understand this...
That all is well
Because the understanding itself may not matter
When you’re pouring water down a well

    





Pourout

I welcome your storms 
Embrace your rain 
Having fallen long before
In a flood
And in being 
There my own being
Found
So I welcome your storm
All around

    





Practice

Pencils pray not to be picked
Brushes roll away and hide
Conversations intentionally aim and miss
Ivory keys pretend not to be alive
The original concept grows wings on the wine
The original truth tries it's best to lie
And I am the one who is for want of all practice
Never let it be said that I never tried

    





Presence By The Shore

Oceans, and

I am the place by hollow shores 
Where salt and osprey meet in airs
Like hurricanes turned on their heads
Like feathers in the fair duress
I fold the melting sands amess
Into being as one they sung
By rocky shoals and jutting reefs 
My currents forever run

I am the presence by the shore, the waters beneath the sun

    





Present In Essence

Presence is a funny thing -

How I am and not aware of me, my being once been and what'll always be. 

As an idealist, present is never enough for me. 

Be it a wish of is, my being once been and what'll always be. 

Whenever I answer before it turns quarter to three. It's not me. 

But at night I am the moon, my being once been and what'll always be. 

- In full, you see. Every night I am free.

    





Present Me

With solemn eyes I look and see, 
The person I think I could be. 

Not a suit nor a tie or an in between,
But a passionate man of many things.

I think, I am, I create to be,
A person who expects more of me.

Though rolled up my sleeves are not unique, 
I want much more than this present me.

    





Preservation

Gentle trees
Harsh Winters
And the mulberry sunlit rays between

Fall down on me like splintering pines
Though the winter scolds
God save the gentle trees

    





Presume The Best

Presume the best
And best meaning first
It's far better than the opposite
Far more trusting than the worst

    





Pretenders Fall

I pretend to know
How the universe and its infinite rivers
flow like dandelion fields alive
When really the only thing which bursts in me
is unknowing and being
in this reactive fall
And as the earth approaches fast below
I ask it why
And plead to fly
For myself no less to all

    





Pretending To Love This Little Earth

One of these days the world will wake up
And I won't be in her bed anymore
Stroll through the earths kitchen commonly
To no blueberry sounds or pancake feelings flat
And then just like that
She'll know and know
That I'm nothing like her
And so this morning
I go

    





Previously Purchased Words

Bumped into your words the other day
In a distant mall of a shopping dream
A little desire, a lot of forget
And I was off again on a spree of me
Unthinking in regards to what you were actually saying
If and when again
And again

    





Priceless Quiet

The gentle quiet of a hollow room appeals to me
Turn off the lights and let me think
Turn off the cost
It's not at all
To be an introvert is cheap

    





Prior Days

Back when I was in love with things or so I thought
I was far too agreeable to everyone
And I often tasted the bitter sting when someone else forgot who I was
But really what I didn't understand was the impermanence of things
How my opportunities were limited 
And how I shouldn't care so much about what other people think
I should've just breathed in and been exactly as I was meant to be
How I should've savored the moments back then
Before the truth of life could find me
And sink my feet into reality

    





Prior Sight

Even when you look at me
Do you see me
Or do you see only
The years and years of your own idealism
Projected upon my being now.

    





Procedural

I used to write just to read on and on
In a listing manner, with a scrolling eye

But no more do I 
Write in such a manner as this 

There’s no desire to be found 
As those days have long since passed me by

And now I only write for myself, the ID
As compared to the length which these pages provide 

And I stop flowing waters 
Dead in their tracks, without so much as a whisper 

Because I’m no longer afraid to speak
Or to be seen here within these imperfect lines

    





Process

Succinctly 
Steadily
Slowly
And with utmost honesty 
Advancing towards the inevitable end
Or so I think
And hope
And pray
To be

    





Profess

I'm a professor who professes to teach beyond the textbook lessons. To approach the very essence of the creative self-expression,

Known as man and known as woman. Call you to a higher ed concessions, to appoint the very purpose of this presupposed oppression,

Of your eyes, and of your mind, I wish you to the other side, of the unguided and unknowing creative self which lies inside. 

Cause what is life without perspective, and what are trials if you do not try, and strive beyond your own horizons, and slide down the back of the other side? 

Will there be shadows on the road, yes, will you trip and stumble, a couple of times, but never let yourself be doubtful of the potential you hold inside,

To create the future, sculpt the present, and tread the clay where it resides. Because in class is where I see you, but in this life you use your eyes, 

To see the self-inside of others, to recreate what's on your mind. To be the difference and the vision, you have the tools to go and try,

And share your view of the horizon, survive the frustration in stride. Become creative in your endeavors, and you’ll bring joy to me and my eyes.

    





Proving To Her Someone

Staring into the eyes of life

And to be not afraid of another day

Is the essence of a man most confidence

And to hold it confidently in such a way

So as not shake or waver within

Or to back away from the wall of change

But a change as it is, is a chance to remain

And to never break from your life's first gaze

    





PS427

As deep calls to deep
Earth to sky
Heart to clearing mind
Clouded atmosphere to crying eyes
So also does my breath in quiet panting
Catch itself within my chest
When you are revealed in celestial being as
And your starlight veil has come to pass

    





Psalms My Dear

For blue eyed want 
   Look to the sky
For tall encouragement
   A Mountian range 
For warmth of hand once felt alive
   The youth of dawn
And for next of kind
  The same old stars to arrive 
Look up, look up, for all that is
   Without frame or screen to hold no more 
Look down and inward for all that's been
   In the Psalm where our first love was born

Remember 
   You need not eyes to see where we were
   Or even where we will be one day

    





Psychosis Deep

Why do we stare into the mirror? 
Why do we turn away from a cosmic gaze? 
Wanting crowns, but afraid of being kings? 
But why? 
Because we humans do not know the depth of things 
Though we like to think we do

    





Puddles

How deep is a puddle? 
Underneath the sky 
Atop the earth 
And soaking into the dirt beside the rugged asphalt 

Created beside the hand of man
How it reaches in 
Just to stir itself into a frenzy 

How it seeks to meddle and mend the crooked stream
From its own perspective  
When the preference is not to wind but to align 

For this I say 
Unto the man 
Who holds the line
With his elbows locked and intertwined

That a winding way is not a way
Or a challenge from the immortal hand 
It's just a steam of the natural 
It's just the earth trying to begin again 

Pulling the water back to the sea 
To grind the eternal rock to sand 

Ever so slowly 

And this is why 
Directly beside your creation
The puddles began

    





Pulling Her Most Gravitational

In the pulling of gravitational love, up
I need not pray for you will also find
that an entirely different universe 
both warming, and cold, and burning
rests in motion there
spinning inside her beating chest 

A taste can only reach so far
so take my sound

    





Pull The Walls

When I focus, I can pull the walls
And create the shadows that only the artist sees

Like the distant corners of the dreary hall
Nobody knows internally what is happening to me

Whenever I focus inward, and throw the ball 
Precariously, towards another

Because when I am focused I am me
And I am never afraid to fall

That is the secret within me
That when I try, I pull the walls 

Inward at a unparalleled speed
Until the path is known to me 

And it narrows out like the distant hall 
Because when I focus, I can pull the walls

    





Puzzle And Piece

Puzzle me
Piece me
Try and place me
As you may
In a more human light
A more natural way

But you cannot
Just as I cannot 

Tip over a pawn 
Without gravitas 
Without leverage
Without a certain sway  
Puzzle over as you must
To piece another way

    





Quarry

Falcons do not concern themselves with inching worms 
Nor bears with minnows 
Nor I with you

    





Question-averse

Quit
Using
Excuses
Since 
Time
Is
Only 
Now

QUESTION, yourself.

    





Questions

Who are you?
    Chaff on the wind?
    Child on the swing?
    An acorn falling midst the thick of Fall?

And what are you?
    A babbling brook? 
    A winding road? 
    Or a born tree with lead lined ink, skyscraper tall? 

Why are you so?
    A constant ache?
    A worried mind?
    A mentality amongst those most small?

And who are you?
    And what are you?
       And why must I ask?
         Are you even here at all?

    





Questions Midst Letters

Ask me not
The question I most want to ask
The letter never sent which flies 
And falls apart between the lines
You think I'm scared of you?
No, not scared...
I'm terrified

    





Questions Of The Eyes

Is a horizon ever uneven, I ask?
Is a perfect wood floor free to fall?
Is a hope, a dream, a wish 
The same old night sky different 
Just viewed differently by all?

I ask the stars, I asked the moon
I'd ask the sun but it just beams
And smiles knowingly in stubbornness 
Having viewed all such horizontal scenes 
As completed unique

No sunset was ever meant to be, it just was

    





Questions Of The Wind And Sky

Does a new wind ever blow or die?
From the same fountain of cloud which has alway given?

In a upward lifting thought of sky
Is the dream relentless?
Or is it just the same day which we've all been living

I ask because I wonder why

Is this the new beginning?

    





Questions Regarding Leaving ?

Do we share this memory ?
Have awakened with horror from this dream ?
Unable to see ?
That intent is always sewn halfway up to the sky alive ?

Are you there with your conscious eyes ?
Do you look for me as I still look yet ?
Or are my shoulders just another silhouette ? 
Another shadow in the sky to forget ?

    





Quiet Is A Comfortable Path

Quiet is a comfortable path
      Known well to ways
    Better to feet
 And most best know to this mind of mine 
         As I create based on what I see
      Scene lived as me, try
   It's not where I've been, or stand that's me, inadequately

    





Quiet Little Secrets

Behind every dusty picture frame
And written on every window pane
Within this empty house of mine
You will find
The quiet little secrets which I left inside 
Before I moved back to the city
To a place where I needed to be
In order to continue my life of ease

    





Quietly talking to no-one in particular

Every day I sit and wait 
  to be paid so that I can sit and wait 
   in public for thoughts to free themselves 
    and hopefully migrate towards the future you 
     who knows me not but wishes for these same things true

    





Quiet Solitary Heart

Prop upon an elbow
Look beyond a lens
Stare into the memories to be
And pray
Whispering quietly
That soon it will be so
And that it never has to end

    





Quiet Things

Deep into the evening, on such a day as this,
An unfathomable amount of whispers escape your lips. 

Mostly quiet things pulled straight from the heart.
Like a shot of whiskey, honest and warm. 

Like a song of time on the radio, 
It's slowly in time that I must let you go. 

Like a dulcet strum, so I heard your last sound. 
Be it far away at the edge of town. 

And yet echoing as your voice is now, 
I hear both your heart and mind call out. 

Begging me to whisper you free,
And remember you as you always wanted to be.

    





Radiance

Snuffed out, 
Like a candle in the thrashing wind.
Your body breaks, 
And we yearn for you and fade away. 

Into the night, 
Until the moment just before the light springs out. 
We dream of you as you drift away,
Into the song. 

Within this place, 
A gift of sound and kind embrace. 
A lover still of life and light. 
Your life illuminates the darkest night.

Glowing was your every sound,
Radiant your very sight. 
Your smile wider than the sun, 
You voiced the passion of this life. 

A candle burning fierce and fast,
Not at both ends,
But in our hearts Christina, 
You will always last the night.

    





Rain Down

Rain…
Down…
Hear the sound of my voice as it
Pounds…
Out…
In the rain hear the words as they
Are…
Now…
Mere reminders of who we once 
Were...
And how…
There is no time left waiting for
Us…
Now…
So as the voices of rain ever fall
Down…
Would you honor me with your 
Reply?
Now?

    





Raindrops Beneath White Roses

Where raindrops crash so quietly
Speaking soft with subtle sounds aloud
And in a language to be seen around
Like moving hands their white ripples fade 
Out into conversations crowned with mist
The kind of sweeping breath alive
Which breaths itself out atop the waters edge
Just as words once hung on the morning dew
Now they wake with joy and are gone the next
As a calming way on this crustless wave
The waters return beneath and rest

    





Raindrops On An Old Roof, A Tanka

Downfall ever sharp
Rainwards on the steeple tall
Propped up on one arm
The building farce built of old
Refuses to fall down cold

    





Raindrops Over The Autobahn

The most ardent kiss which the asphalt will ever know
  Is when mother nature bows her head
    Purses her clouded cotton lips  
      And gently drops a trillion kisses on a square stretch of highway 
        Until they puddle up in joyful memory 
          And the autobahn is lost in a contented, smitten, bliss

    





Rain Fail

Expecting the next words [you taste] to save you. Is like praying for rain to [never] stop, and it will.

    





Raining, Alone

No weatherman warned me
About the downfall of you

About the pouring out of emotive soul 
Which encompassed the morning 

In a matter of seconds, falling
Like a haze of pensive dew

And now I cannot unseen the sight
Or the falling skies of you

    





Rainsoaked

The heavy patter of the rain
Reflects the pattern of my heart
In weariness 
In longings last
How I've waited for this storm to pass
Most patiently
Slowly pouring out
With a cooling voice
Till I calm myself 
And yet so much more than the afterstorm
Which I must create 
Everytime I've felt
The need to be
More than this old me
This rainsoaked version of the self

    





Rainwish

I wish this mood upon a puddle
And then find myself drying
When it does not last
What a gas
This is

    





Rainy Lofi Day Away

Rain
Lofi

Careless 
Timeless

Hopeful
Remembrance

Midst
Splashing Sounds

I 
love
The way
You shuffle me

The way
You fall 

On me
And all around

    





Rainy Snack

Granola pattering between my teeth.

Rain crunching beneath my feet.

Wait a minute... 

Was that what it ought to be?

    





Random Blurbs

It doesn't matter if I haven't. Because I've seen enough to cloud my eyes a thousand times over...

The open road is openly, the place for an open opportunity of mind...

Pictures placed at the heart of mankind, do not last. Not even the servers will satisfy or survive...

Every word I ever wrote about the ever loving trees was never for me...

Turn a new page, open up. Maybe today you will not stop and let the story die inside. But instead draw it out, into the pages where it ought to reside...

Love is such a shallow thing, its nothing like it presents itself to be...

Give me a structure that is not my own and I will not believe in it. Tell me my structure I cannot do and I will invest hours thinking about it. Excited for it...

The only truly haunted walls are those that are plain and bare of thought...

    





Reaching

Reach out ... when all around is falling down
When snows delay dissolves in hope 
And sun is dashed by weathered time alike
Stand up, in being, when nothing's left
No place to rest or lay your weary head
In misery and mind alike
Reach up ... until your old bones stretch
And with a cracking desire your weariness fades 
Like the common sky into the masked clouds alike

    





Reading? Glasses?

Adjust your glasses
Ever slight 
The way your shoulder turns a corner
Such a beautiful pattern, not in shirt
But within your features glowing bright  
Expressive as the newborn day
Collected as the cooling night
Adjust your glasses once again 
A habitual study within sight

    





Reality

I'm a typical human
Looking into a fishbowl
Expecting to see an ocean

    





Reality Check

When your standards are so high
That birds cannot perch
And construction workers, who work
Have the option of throwing themselves from above
Then perhaps it's time
To reconsider your own
And come down from the clouds
Lest someone ends up getting hurt

    





Realization

I'm not myself when I write like this.

I am no more than a memory.

An ink well river which flows and bleeds on tempered sands.

Forever resting at the foothill of childhood. 

I am.

    





Real-ization

Dark days have crept slowly into the month of my mind, and with spring so far away I just don't know, how my summer hope will survive.

    





Reaper

Shadows dance across the collar
A striking contrast above the eyes
And there beneath the pavement lies
Where the contors whip and flee
Where the hollow outlines always try 
And run and hide

    





Rebecca, A Tanka

Radiant your dawn 
Untied meaning ever yours
A joyous lifted
Hymnal light as spoken word
Be here not gone from my side

    





Receding

Show me a world
In which I’ve slowed myself down 
To the point where I can see my own point of mind
My own line and where it ends
And when

    





Recent Times

Recently 
And more so than the mountains

I've been blue

I've been tired 
And I've been steeped in fog

But most of all 

I've been living without coffee every morning 
Which is the same as living without you

    





Red Castles

Red castles crash and fall
Midst green pines standing tall

As the last summers memory outlasts
This autumn death befalls

    





Red Eye

Red lights in the night sky
Twelve eyes
Blinking at me curiously
On top of towers which fail to pierce the sky
They wink at me
Almost knowingly
For I am tall and lean like these
Blinking often into the night
Clearly in sight
But rarely ever truly seen
For more than an instant
Or more than a two eyes
Just for a moment 
Like the red eye passing by
I blink
Because I'm still alive

    





Red, Yellow, Green

Life, the earth
Like traffic lights
Yurn, regardless of you
Your direction of self

And based on perception 
We all stop
We all go
And get *******

    





Reflected In The Trees

I see the sunlight in the trees, the newness of the summer night. 

The rich green leaves, fresh cut grass and the threat of autumn. Ever in sight.

And every root and bark and stem is reflected in the builder of my own home. 

For it will be a reflection of me, my power, my arms. Finite. Strong.

    





Reflectivemake

You're a gleaming coin in a wishing fountain 
A reflection of God to me

    





Regarding Feelings Felt

When I think about it. Like the dawn forgotten. Such feelings begin before we're even aware of them. Grow before we can even control them. And usually break before we could begin to explain them. Steadily forward and with a vision of hope, we all flow and have feelings floating around in our heads. Well most.

    





regarding humanity, my frustration

There are days when I am in love with eyes
the world in looks
and the passing by glances
of a newfound friendship, and fondness revived 

And then there are days
like this one en which,
there is not enough dirt on the surface of the entire earth 
to cover all of you

    





Regarding Mental Anguish

You know half of the worries
More than that…
ALL of the worries inside your head 
Are entirely your own 
And therefor are in need of one thing
OWNERSHIP if you please
For it would please you more than such constant worry
To be free of such things

    





Regarding Such Feelings

The height of the stars
The depths of the ocean
The colors of the flowers
And the warmth of a summers morn
No human heart nor hand to hold
Is responsible for making you
Feel with such feelings as these adorn

    





Regarding The Flames

When it comes to fire
Within my arms
I will crash and burn and rebuild myself 

Because I am
Because I was 
And because I have yet to become someone else

All that I can be
All that I wasn't
All that I do is because I must

Its not owned by this
The want or wont
But because I will regret it if I don't

    





Regardless

If no one reads
If no one comments
It still exists 
It still IS

    





Regardless And Unending

When the air is cold, and the night is darkest, because the clouds refuse to let the stars shine.

When the quiet sound at last is heard, echoing atop the snow.

When there is a will within and a will for me.

To return to you, with words anew.

Because all of the quietness of the calming nights and winters resting urn, cannot separate you from my thoughts. 

Regardless and above.

The stars still burn.

    





Regardless of Ratio

You know
There will always be 
More smiles
More good people

    





Re-Injured

Just when I thought
I was fully to mend
And started walked thereout
The ache in limping form returned 
With my reign at an end like a summers warmth 
Guess it's time to limp off
And in trying begin again

To walk

    





Relapse

I suspect that I also am your old drug as well
It's just that you're clean 
And ever cleaner than me
I suspect that's what commitment does to people
It keeps them clean
As clean as can be

    





Relational Wish

May rivers flow into streams
And stray in whatever direction they need
In order to reach the inevitable sea

    





ReMark

And here's the only place 
Where I can share this honest truth
That all I've wanted for weeks now has been
To hear most any words from you

    





Remember

No matter how tall you walk
How modern you get
How far you seem to fall
Or how hard you try and forget

The stars will always wink and smile
The waves will always crash goodbye
Just as the sun will always set on you
And the earth will always rise

And so you shall also remember
Until the day you die

    





Remembering A Fellow

Give me a quiet day
Where someone remembers 
The tallness of trees
And the will to stop and speak to them
To wake them up and then

    





Remembrance

Just in case this</em> all falls through
And one of us can or cannot</em> be
Exactly who we wish to be
Would you remember me as I am right now?
And I'll remember you like this
As the girl of dreams 
Mixed with the memory of *what could've been

    





Remembrance Now

I'd forgotten here
That the most beautiful place in the world is round

That the future I see beyond the horizon Is now
Above this place
My hometown

I'd forgotten here
But I remember now

    





Reminder to self

Life is a spectrum of arrogance and meekness. Sway not to either side for too long, but balance yourself in perfect humility, as you live your story and see it unfold before you. Not as planned, but as you had hoped.

    





Remove Your Own Feelings

A coach 
Should be those
Who care about others
More than their own feelings
Be they of self or should be

They should care more about others
Because they already know themselves

Not the other way around

    





Repetitious Me

Some paths are too well tread for me
And through other thrown
In the woods of obsession known
Are remembered by me all too well

    





Residual you my cold lover memory

Like the dark cold which seeps
Through the base edges of the windowsill
Quietly and without self control
Or even the willingness to be instilled 

So you seep through me like winters thaw
My bones alive with heat 

And here with just the brushing glance where I thought I was safe
You seep

    





Resonates

Whatever that song would look like... 
I swear that you could see it in my eyes
Reflected here
Right now
Within this moment 
Where I am alive

    





Responsibility

All that a man wants
     But does not have. 
Can be traced back 
     To him, indefinitely.

Because all that a man 
     Is required to do
Is to speak the truth.

And to ask with an open
     Honest heart
With a fearless
     Mindful propensity.

    





Rest Full

Rest is neither for the living nor the dead
No, rest is a response 
To both the condition known as life and death
Rest is something entirely different
And neccessary, and comforting, and terrifying 
This
Such rest is not always best
But needed nonetheless 
We rest
In each other, away from each other, with each other

All the best

    





Restless

I'll find no rest in this old home
Another house beneath my feet
Like sands which shift on a foreign shole
I am the comber of this beach

With every night alive I wake
To wind which howls
And a bed which aches

Though guilty as my leave may be
I can no longer sleep within this place

    





Restore My Mind

Darling verse would you distract me?
Take me away from this wretched place,
And return to me my sense of self? 

Restore my mind and all that it holds, 
Rekindle a fire within my veins.
And bring me back to the days of old?

To a time when life was young and alive.
To a life that I lived on the other side,
Of this placid coin, would you turn once again?

And restore to me to my place amongst men?
Would you bring me back to this present day,
And then gather my sorrows to whisk them away? 

-SS

    





Resuscitate Me

Press my chest like the pillow 
Breath your love back into me 
Until I can see your hair swaying with ease
Softly like the whims of the summer willows
Would you resuscitate the lover in me?

    





River Rocks

Does every rock in every river
Dictate its place accordingly?
No, it takes centuries and ages
To find it's many moving places
To smooth out all of it's rough edges
And to be accordingly

    





Rivers, My Tanka In Flow (S7)

Don't wake me darling
I have no worry once here
Where rushing life finds
Every flowing finger free
And contented rivers be

    





River Vision

Find me in this flow of day
Till the warmth of sight escapes my bones
And in realization that this rivers flow
Is no more than water, no less than true
In its careless, passing, way it goes
And so speaks to me in a rippling ease
Reassuringly to let me know
That I am almsot free
Of my own being, in alone

    





Roads

I’m afraid of walking down this road. 
Terrified that one day I will not be able to go back and smell the flowers. 
That all of the beautiful scenes of my youth will have passed. 
And that I somehow did not designate enough time, 
To hold them close, to see them clear, and somehow make them truly last. 
I’m fearful of roads, because of that.
And I fear how quickly underneath my feet they seem to pass.
Created by these human hands, designated by men, and traveled by kings.
The fear of walking down such roads too quickly, 
Is most definitely a haunting thing.

    





Roads Which Be

Well traveled roads 
Are not to be looked down upon
Are not always in being bad
Or even good

But they are well traveled 
If you frequent them
And if your feet call for home
And out of your existence traced back there to where

Then in being and bound
There will be no shame
For it is as it would
As they should

    





Rolled Out

I’m going to plaster my words on the walls of life
Like paper
That way you cannot avoid me
Or the memory of mine

Just as a heart will not be cheap
Or doted upon everywhere
Or rolled out with ease 

But plastered meticulously
That’s me

    





Rolling Thoughts of An Ocean You

Long walks 
Cloudy eyes 
Quiet thoughts of you in mind

The Atlantic turning like a phantom fog 
With dark words beneath, and even brighter skies

To illuminate the hopeful flame
Of the flickering all, of all once kind

Know that these waters turn for you
And in hindsight turn, for me and mine

    





Ronald Reuel

Did he know?

That the stories he'd create
That the characters which he'd sow 
Together all at once 
Would so quickly grow in the minds of those
Who would follow along and fellowship
Together on this ever winding road? 

For wherever there is rock and stone
Or root and earth
Be it on mountain tops or in the valleys below
How his stories over and over again
Will ever accumulate and flow
Through the minds of many so and so's 

Did he ever realize the significance of this though?

    





Rooftop

Moonlight falls 
In glorious hues
Of blueberry blue

And settles on roof tiles
Once worn so thin
And installed so new

That an age has since passed
Since the feeling of last
Me atop there with you

    





Rooted Deep In Self

My strength is like a weathered tree
Though shanken on the surface blown
And thrown about in raptures occasionally 
Your summer storm will not shake me
Or in my roots well known, feel anything

    





Rough Cut Edges

With an edge like brick
Not beautiful by any means

So curt you are
As spoiled milk

Yet I'm unturned
And therefor left

Alone to drink
In this uncomfortable way

    





Rude Awakenings

You should expect no human to satisfy you
To meet the need or the needful want
You will only find a distraction there
Be it a beautiful or a most handsome one

But instead look up to beyond the sky 
And find yourself there in he who will not fall 
Because when you wake from a distracting dream
It can certainly make you question it all

    





Ruler

The emperor, the conqueror 
Commanding every confidence 
Cold, calm and under control
A version in the past tense 

A shadow lock atop a cliff
Staring into the abyss 
Humanity is underneath
The very point of his fingertip

And yet he waits for what might be 
And casts his eye on every scene  
Having seen the way the world did bend
Beneath the bow tyranny 

His hands hold out and underneath  
The sovereignty which is at hand 
But always will he watch the streets 
For the enemy of every man

    





Rumbling Songs

The songs which shake me moreso
Than the rumble strips on the freeway
Break down my all my hope and change 
And strip me of the passing you
And also of my memory outside the window

    





Run

If I knew
I would've done
If I'd known
I wouldn't have never ran away from it

    





Running In The Rain

As the rain falls down
So my feet sound out
And pad the coated asphalt ground
And the truth is there for me to find
That running warm and in that storm
Those were the best few miles of my life

    





Running Poetry

His heart is a furnace,
Burning ever, furiously 

And in the brightness, there is no language,
To try and describe what it is he sees,
Within his eyes of steel

He laughs at life, and grits his teeth,
To bear the weight upon his chest 

A road of Tankas beneath his feet, 
To pave his way, 
Both in and out of the wilderness 

And to speak his sound, is most profound, 
But it will never sound out quite the way you think 

Because his word are but a memory,
A jarring song, which for some reason,
He never bothers to sing

So you can wait, and you can hope, 
That steely glance you might just catch 

But hold your breath beside a furnace, 
Because all things good, and all things burning,
Will not forever burn nor last

    





Running Water

Drop a smooth stone in a pond
And no one sees the ripple
Skip a stone on a running river
And the ripple is consumed

    





Run-On Coffee

I need coffee
Before this coldness leaves my feet
Or the snowflakes fall any freer onto the city streets
I need such coffee inside of me
Because without it’s joy and prolonged warmth
I cannot be alive and well
Let alone this representation of me
So do not question before I wake
Just pour the coffee for goodness sake
And if I must make it myself
I will with a vengeance, a sleep induced will
Though once I’m awake I’ll wonder still
What dependency is this which I’ve built
The need to mix my water mixed with beans
Perhaps not the coffee, but it is the caffeine
Which gets me out and wakes me up
So that I might not feel asleep
As I am driving these winter roads
Saying dearest coffee would you please
Wake me so that I can feel at ease

    





Sadly No

Does a paintbrush try and press itself? Or a fisherman cast to feel his own strength?

No.

Likewise, does a moon know when its been idealized by the idealistic pen? Again and again.

Not likely.

Can you see through the colors of your own eyes? Or hear the kissing secrets of the wind on its lovers lips?

No, thankfully not.

And in choosing can you pull thought from mind? With an ease which sets you free to be taller than trees and freer than snow.

Sadly it is with me, when I say no.

    





Salmon In The Sky

I love when colored salmon spawn
And leap with ease over towns on high
With rippling waves and glistening sheen
How they bound between these rocky outcrop clouds
And spread their whispy tendril fins
Across the cascading pinkish sky
I love the night just before it breathes
Quiet as waivering gills unseen
When the salmon color seeps into the sky

    





Salt In The Mountains

I am not
The height of all heights 
No
Nor will I undersell my flavorfulness
The salt of the earth
And those reasons why
Are why I will not let it grow

    





Saltwater, Freshwater

When given a choice 
   Between Beauty and lust
Let Beauty win out
   Lust is never enough

    





Sand And Sea

Building sand castles which you will never see
Until reclaimed by the waves
Though under your feet I'll never be
No
Just as all of the sea shells have long since flown
To be remembered by only their empty crustaceans
So also will every memory be 
Forever rolling over itself 
Crashing down all around anothers name
And this change of tide is alright with me
Very much so
Very much where the sand meets the sea

    





Sand Castles

There is weakness in two just as in one
A sandcastle of constituents
Molded and bound together beneath the basking sun
But the conjoining doesn’t change the component
Nor make it any more fun to be
The most honest version of the newest one 
Certainly sand has its own set of difficulties

    





Satirical Stones

Your stormy words
   Cut through the clouds 
      Dry as rain
And falling like stones 

Hailing from another earth 
   I feel the weight 
      The desperation
Long before they reach the ground

Such weight embraces 
   This trepidation

    





Saying Goodbye

The world is hollow 
It swallows whole 
Your parents and mine 
And me
And us

    





Say This And Outlast

I have trudged and rolled through the cold wintery days and the springtime of freedom is here at last.

You will not spoil this for me. 

You too will pass.

    





Scenic Tears

When I'm here
My eyes are full of scenic tears
And I tilt my head back to hold onto them
Because the beauty overwhelms me

    





Scratch

My heart is scratched
But I won’t say or sway 
Or look at the gaping space within 
Guess it was never known 
That I felt this way

    





Sean's Haiku

Regret has no name
In a life well lived with lone
Expectations loud

    





Searching

"Beneath the sky, above the grass un mowed and growing high.

There lives a quiet seamless wind, which whispers words in the back of my mind.

It questions me and my own being, and inquires as to if I am wasting my time.

Searching throughout humanity, for someone so practical and pure of heart, who I never was actually intended to find."

    





Searching through dark stars untamed

I can see it
Clear as night

The future as it breathes
Life as it could be 

And I, am I
In all of my unbeing

Have nowhere left to search 
Or find, even

I am at odds with what I ought to be

    





Seasoned Water

Green leaves over water 
Fear no Fall from Autumn graces 
They embrace it

    





Seattle

When your lover limps away 
Into the dark of that good night 
Which makes you question your memory of the light 
There is only one thing to do or say 
To try and minimize that loss 
Which is to say nothing at all
But to move away to another town 
Where just around every waking corner
There isn’t a different memory to be found
Of her, of Maggie 
That's why on the plane ticket now
I can see from the boarding pass
That for Seattle we're bound
To begin again without the blackbird 
To a place far away
Where hopefully we won't have to say
Bye bye to someone like her again 
At least in that specific way

    





Secrets

I pretend - And with infatuations paint at life
         with colors sound
         until this be known
To all those wishfully waiving trees 
          who choose to grow 
          in such close proximity to me  
That the secret is - I’ll never know what I want to be

    





Seeing

Ensnaring eyes no more be seen
But the memory of you
This power over me
Since the first I see
In dreams

    





Seeing Backwards

Until the stars crash, the clouds wave back with whisking foam. Twinking, glowing, black with morning dew to greet this coming you alive. 

Until affections rise in reflective ways, as moon and stars unite, with pinions that of a lovers embrace. 

To stay, I must until such heaven returns, and reunites with soul to be, believed. Know that I want to, but for me. I will only think of you beneath walking trees, with thoughts small as bugs beneath celestial day. In my own time and wantingly, quietly way.

    





Seek It (now)

Comfort is the greatest killer
Of every dream and wish unborn
Be not afraid of end of days or of Sundays spent in mournings morn

Embrace, embrace
Walk calmly this
Over the living earth and lifeless breeze 

Of this dominion, breathe
Out the nothingness
Discomfort you seek

    





See Me?

Secretly - I sit
And by windows - wait
Knowing - being
Breathing - seeing
That the world - will not
But hoping that you - just might

    





See Me As I Fall For You

My heart is in a higher place right now
Though it will fall as all stars do 
Until nickel burns cold 
And ember embeds outside of sandy towns 
Under cloudy moonlit eyes to see 
Would you please?
Watch me fall, as all stars do 
And in my tumbling known
As if you could not catch 
Me my most human ground
Would you?

I only ask because I'm burning
For you to watch

    





Seen, See

Everywhere I go, unseen 
The prevailing narrative being
"I could not speak to he"

Tall and menacing 
Quiet and stern
So well and in his pace, to flee

Looking quietly past the height of me
And quickly away by chance 
But you

In passing with a scrolling spree
I adore when you can read as this
I adore when you see me

    





Seep

And here
Settled like in water
I am going to sink into you like a falling stone
Like a tree half buried in the peat moss slow grown

Into you 
I will seep anew

    





See The Rain

Some days I wish to soak the earth,
Some days I wish to return to the simple mindedness of the dirt, 
To a time when I knew less about me,
And more about how I wished to improve.
When I see the rain, such as it is, I think of this,
And afterwards I think of you.

    





See The Sea?

I am an ocean
All men are
But especially me

You can look and see
Now for yourself
And also this 

Within my name
Can you see?
The Sea?

    





See this?

The most beautiful light 
Is the bounding brightness 
Which leaps off of perfect snow 
And catches high in the ceiling eyes alive 

Such a vision will be forever alive in me.

See this?

    





See, Woo, Court

It is the dance before the long dance
With music played for two
With one a mask, and one unmasked
We linger still
Until the truth of the song is renewed

    





Self Argument

All descriptors
And ideas of self
Fade like the days spent walking
Down the path of possibly

And time
Time lasts just as surely
As it waits for no man named me

Hence why
Is the question which I ask myself
Must I try and be
When I've already become

    





Self Authoring

Are you seeing this?
This is why the home.
Because sometimes you have to be a part of someone else's story in order to be able to write your own.

    





Self Disgust of Sorts

I hate being human. 
I hate the waiver. 
Because the things that I do habitually, aren't even me. 
I just learn them.
Slowly. 
Steadily. 
The learned yet subconscious, Me.

    





Self Fear

Scared of you, no
Terrified of me, please

Is there a question mark to be marked in here?

    





Self Help

The self says no
You cannot be
All that you once we're never me

Albeit truth past all within
There is also future time yet spent
To be more than all that has ever been

So move yourself 
Til you you move again
Before the self can find it's voice and then

Would you tell yourself 
You must 
You can

    





Selfish

Old words cry out
For more of themselves
And I 
A selfish wordsmith unfound
Have nothing but headaches in mind
For them

I'm sorry
But you'll never begin again 

Not

    





Selfish Man

I could dry my skin and be like the bark 
As one day I may sprout like a tree 
Once again
But never in the moments to pass 
Can I survive and be content 
With thoughts that aren’t mine
Even if conjured up for a good cause 

Because I write for the mind 
As I am of the mind 
And though I love the natural pass
The whim of the willow and waves which crash 
Know this about me 
I am as selfish as any human can be 
So please appreciate it when it’s for you

Because most of the time my prose are for me

    





Self-Stifling

Once was given a great gift of voice 
To sing loud and be heard before many a thousand
But the crowds silenced me, as I preferred to sleep
And speak less with the world a burden 

I am selfish I find
Asking for differently
As my own first motivation is the speech within me
It is what is, will be

    





sending you parts of myself

When I click, or scratch, or dial the wheel
or breathe out slow smoke, one, two three. 
When I kick and grasp at nothing, and something
which grows high as the sky, and slowly as the trees, you see?  
How the ink runs dry
and the intent an ocean quells.
That each time the clock unwinds 
another mountain flood, rolls itself down
onto an unsuspecting parchment town.
Little this is never free; the known things, 
And why I send to you these things, 
each time alive when I am found

    





Sensations

There is an innocence about it 
A sensation which slightly glows
And illuminates, the half of it
But does not act out of cluelessness
Or carelessness 

No, it's a state of care free thoughtfulness
In which this kind of being exists 

It hates the plow
It hates the system 
It simply is
It simply lives 

It connects itself to many things
And many people 
With a genuine and expressive tone
And an innate sweetness inside of it

And when this sensation sleeps
The small corners of the world as they are
In one way or another
Are at peace

And when I am near 
It is the same as when I am not
Behaving with steadfastness 

And as it listens quietly
It puts me at ease 
As I see it now, for what it is, in its innocence

And when given the opportunity to speak
I care for it
And yet, I cannot understand it's simplicity 

In sight
It is a twist of hair in the seamless breeze 
How it wavers without want or will

It simply is 
A mess, yet controlled
And always in its own way, and by its own will

Deep water can be cold and treacherous 
But shallow water can break, be seen and is warm
I love the water, but not like this
And not to submerge
That's not for me

Though these purveyors of sensation are incredibly 
Unimaginably sweet

    





Sensing Vs. Stirring

There is the immediate air out of which you breathe
And those who live for it
And those who see the effects of the breeze 
And attempted to speak for it

    





Sensory Overload

With noise abound
Joy all around
I can feel the springs of my legs wind up
And yearn to give out

Propel me into this future alone

I **** at saying goodbye everytime

    





Sensory Swim

When the water boils 
The pasta spine breaks
And the sizzling bake refuses to stop
I lose myself in the aroma around
Cooking like this
I am 
Soundly simmering within the not
And at the same time
Lost
In the time which stops

    





Sent To You, On The Breeze

When a tune is sent
And whistled on a summer's breeze
For someone in particular, noone

Mother nature reaches out
Grasping at the mail of straws 
And delivers nothing (more than that which she has already received)

    





Separate

I am drawn apart</em> 
Cut in half</em>
Separated</em>
Like the sea</em> 
Both the color</em>
And the overcast</em>
Reside in me</em>
But do not think</em>
For a second</em> 
That they are</em>
The same in me</em>
For they are separate</em>
And aside</em>
On the other side</em> 
O*f the other me

    





Separation Skies

The most beautiful essence of memory
is the breeze.

The most powerful beat of the drum
is the heart.

The thunder paints colors in my ever clouding head,
and rumbles to be heard once again with ease.

In all of your astounded ears, surreal, would you please? 
I wish to be whole and not in part.

    





September Sky

My eyes open wider
My shoulders drop to my chest 
When I simply survey the beautiful September sunset
I am alive
And colored like this 
The inner sky 
Painted that same old orange and salmon 
Which no palette can describe

    





Serendipitous you, humorous me

Write my old name
Brand new in a book
For your serendipitous 
Ultra ompintotus almost belief
Until our discovery it does keep
Within the dark deep abyss of this
Not knowing as it is, you will one day see
That boy oh boy, was Barnes &amp; Nobles ******

    





Servants And Performers

How quickly the feeble minded forget
About the trials and struggles once offset
By those who have a servants heart

And in handling such people
Who slander you and tear your tedious work apart 

The honest response to all of this
Is that this could indeed be considered an art

To kindly withhold with each remark 
When you are parted from the comfort of their kind words
Which tend to play out on the stage 

How quickly do the others forget 
About everything, that is except for their own parts

    





Settle me like rain

Rain knows how to sit so still
Once fallen from grace and gracious sky alike

Yet I 
The man who can never stand
To sit for more than a minute still
Or to contain his mind for more than a second alive

Could learn quite a bit from this rain of yours
Not the least of which that it was never mine

How I watch you fall and settle still
Just to listen until I smile wide

And then at last we are at an end
A settling of some mysterous kind

    





Shades Of Blue

Just know 
It’s OK
If your heart’s a thousand colors 
Because my eyes have a thousand of their own

    





Shadows Length

Nobility knows no ends
Just as moonlight know no bounds
Besides the will of shadows 
Which stretches out beneath 
And lies in the most familiar heights 
Drawn out upon the ground

    





Shadowwebbed

The spiderwebbed shadows reach
Out like friendly hands
From the feet of trees known only to me
On both this way and in this moment
They grasp at feet belonging to us
And thoughts owned more by me

Yup

    





Shadowy, Friday, Fog

Quiet shadows
  Cooling coffee
Tiredness behind the eyes 
  And light
A cheap little luminescent lamp 
  In the corner of me 
But the wrong corner
  To write about such worlds as these

    





Shadowy time, but a Tanka

Skies fall down slowly
As shadows lie beneath these
Most mountainous truths
Stretching out like outcrops down
In walking ways was our youth

    





She A Buzzing Reader, Read Me Fast

Aimless words 
   Were known to me
       In many few 
During days like moons 

     But you, but you
           Were a sunshine moment
    In a fleeting sky 
Behind both eyes

 And now our words
Would be like bees
    In pollinated thought 
           And buzzing minds alive

    





She, A Wave

A wonderful wave
Was that one
With focused crash and seady swell
Collar crest to ride and grasp 
With raven hair and wavering curl
Her earthy eyes
A perfect tide for anyone born of waves
But as for my shores 
I couldn't stand the neutrality of the sea
For the rest of my years
And just waved goodbye

    





She A Wonderful Storm Unpredictable

One day I looked up
And there was a storm   
With all of its ominous brooding and I      
Having thirsted and been dry         
(for far too long)            
Rejoiced at your reign               

At your returning alive

    





She Doesn't Belong In My Calm

Like snow on the rails 
Trampled leaves on the grounded trees 
Fleeing light
Familiar scent well known
And the lasting stars you cannot always see
But are still there
The wait is having
My heart a quiet rustle in the summer breeze 
Just go and live
Be it amongst noise or fog
As you hold not a single familiar scent or sound
Over me
You are winters cold 
And your crackling quiet frustrates me 
Just go
Please

    





Sheepish-thought

I'm trying
To corral this herd of nothing
Into something orderly
With hint of white and spotted stain

I'm trying

    





She had a southern heart turns out

Don't hate the snow 
Or the cold of life
  A breath is still your choice to breathe
And if you wanted to (so badly)
Noone is stopping you (but you)
  Maybe you should leave

    





She Had Wings

From a window I saw an Oriole bright
When my eyes were young
And my prospects light

On a breeze of fancy fluttered her wings
And with a flicker of power
She flew away 

And I hadn't though about her wings
Or how on the wind she would glide and sway 
Until today, until today

    





She / He / Addiction

One of the most dangerous universes you can look into, get lost within, and lose yourself to...


...is someone else.

    





She Is Ember

You are ember with less orange 
You are tree bark true and brook trout at play 
You are earthy as the hollow dell in the Catskills still
Turning as the waterways 

You are ever moving, always slight 
Looking back over those delicate shoulders of yours
To the footprints of me 
And in the time spent therein not a day’s older 

I don’t know her name
But I know what I see

    





She Is Thunder

Fumbling words in the night sky, 
Like thunder in the broadest storm. 
So you will go down in historic mind,
As not very bright. 

Though the stroke of lightning might be me, 
You were like thunder above the trees, 
Loud, assertive and absolute,
But never available to be seen. 

I'm glad such sound was not for me, 
And that you passed like a summers night. 
Because I have no need for rumbling voice,
Or an ominous noise devoid of light.

    





She Loves Baseball

From brews, to baseball, to the Caesar salads we both like to eat

You were the potential just out of reach
The distant hope, the fear internalized
The not knowing when, or how, or if, we would ever meet

For once, for real, instead of on screens
Like the reflections in my galleries
I see you now in photos with him
Seeing both what is and could’ve been

Yet there you are by your father's side 
Striding down the aisle inside, of another man’s church
Another man’s mind    

I just hope that he loves baseball like me
And that he can paint the corners outside 
Almost perfectly, just like a Rembrandt

Though I missed you this time by a single stride 
I never felt like the game began
Because we both looked down that distant road 
And you, glanced back, at a map inscribed

</em>On that, with this, I bid you goodbye, and wish you well until the 9th

    





She smelled like Autumn

Uncharted days
Ahead stretch out
Like a season known
With all its ends

And the scent of you
The smell itself
Is what keeps me back
From running therein 

Essence, my cornerstone

    





She was wild like a storm

Heavy is nothing
This no weight being your graceful self
When defined and falling from the heavens felt
But am lost upon impact
And in these splashings all around 
My head is awash in the ends of summer
With just these droplets of youall anew

    





She Would Say

Revisit me my dear revised, see only me. 
For I am a glutton for your eyes. 
It’s deep within you've always seen, 
The subtleties I've stored inside. 

Said and implied, I love the way, 
You scroll through each embellished line.
Besotted we were supposed to be, 
An author and his beloved rhyme.

Within your book and by your side, 
Is where I remain and to page I bind. 
Don't leave without such fond embrace, 
Or forget where we first met in mind.

Stay here instead and share my bed, 
Rehearse my prose and read my rhymes.
Aloud we sound, like your favorite song. 
Would you say my name just one more time?

    





Shift your feet

The dream of being
One day more
(than you already are)
Is **** of sleep
And of walking nowhere

    





Shine

Like a far
From a distant star
I wanted you like a childhood wish
So badly that I couldn’t help but shine
And glow in the innocent, youthful, darkness

    





Shining In The Sky

Those who are not just "I am"
Glow like stars in the night sky
And serve others
Even if they do not know it
As guides
In the absence of light
Is where they shine most bright

    





Shinkai Skies

I'd forgotten how much I loved those skies
How I looked with wonder back into them
How I learned to love the cascading white
Which, like smoke, separated blue from blue
And turned the salmon pink sunsets of old
Back into the born nights of youth

I love you still, though it is I who have moved

    





Shooting Stars, A Tanka

The stars know no cold
Like the lonely walking minds
Who know, what it means
To be more than just burning
Atmospheric dust yearning

    





Short Tower

At the top of every ivory tower
        Is a steeple proud and tall

At the top of everybody's body, is a head 
        Be it hollow or whole in all

    





Showering Together

I had a thought 
the other day
(in the shower).

And we
(in our fooling around)
both slipped and fell
on a bar of soap
called reality.

Painfully fun it was.

    





Showers Before Bed

Short wet hair in wild sheets
With seeping eyebrows bent with dew
Tired breath, warm chest
And memory foam
Soft cotton sleeves layered like carved stone
And quiet cold from windows still
Our heads beneath these pair of sills
With heaving breaths in unison bound
Our heartbeat drums the only sound 
Amidst these vibrant warms around
Mere unity I'm pleased
Surrounds

    





Shy

Sing songs of the mountains alive and well

Whisper soundless secrets of nothing and wind

Reach out beyond the starry distant clouds

Grasp straws at the ocean rivers flowing in

Hold back the new dawn with a concrete hand

Lift rain from its fallen puddling end

Declare time that itself shouldn't exist and then

Doing all of these things would be easier still, than summoning the courage to speak with you again

    





Side By Side

It's the doubt which grows in the back of your mind
That you're on the wrong side of the road
That you're going to collide
But not with fate
But head on with an eternity of unkind

Side by side are different directions
Same road and minds

    





Sifting Words

Stomach full of stream and sand, sometimes I sift gold. 
Passing through to understand,
that fingers never hold.

    





Sight Unified

I love the world most

When it let's me be

To just sit and breath

And to think of these

Most fervent truths

Which are known to noone

And inparted to everyone

As a part of me 

In our seeing we are one

We are free

    





Significance

A word from noone 
Means nothing at all

But a word from someone 
Of significance

Is more harmonized than the angels’ song and more beautiful than the most heartfelt verse to ruminate within the soul

    





Signifisong

This song is the sound
Reincarnate of love 
Feels like to me
In the absence of be
And yet
This song is the sound
Of reincarnated love
Indeed

    





Signs

Some mountains just refuse to be climbed
Don't dispair, or blame, or take it personally
No, the no trespassing signs are of their own design

    





Silent Dusk

At the end of the day
Say nothing
Because 
It is the end
And over

    





Silent Meaning

Ill will held on
Dries out my hands
And cracks in the sky are never welcome
Hence why the attempt is never planned
Though apart from my old self
I find, I am
And yet
With contented say grown out of sigh
Though I may be quiet
Having pushing myself far away
In the silence, know this
You are always welcome 
Le nathlam hí

    





Silent notes and songs

It's neither strong nor weak to be alone
Neither heroic nor cowardice, to try or to not
There are simply those who prefer the company of many songs
And those silent notes who do not

    





Silmarils

Hold my hands, look into me and see the truth.

Meet me in the deepest part of the glowing forest.

If your heart is there, next of Gondolin, the same as mine.

How beautiful the stars to shine atop our heads.

Like the crowns of old. As the glowing trees ignite your eyes.

As mine have glistened at this very thought.

Perhaps to meet you there at all,

Would make my heart glow as a Silmaril.

For not even I know when this glow was crafted.

Formed out of the unknown and the song.

I wait for you.

Though to Varda your eyes,

And Yavanna your heart may forever belong.

    





Silt Settling Beneath Cold Water

Deep and somber currents cold 
Turn beneath a calming surface young 
As darkness subsides above as below
No older have I grown

(4LINE)

    





Similar Perplexities

Seeing he
with you together
The similarities
do not perplex
So much absolve 
Me of the truth
That at least in together
you’re with someone
like me
Maybe
a little bit

    





Similar Shoes

My hollow frame is but a shell
A time trodden path
I've seen my father walk
And his shoes, his shoes 
Are so familiar to my feet
Though perhaps a bit too small
They are like family to me

    





Similar Thoughts

On days like this
With <strong>heavy flakes</strong> 
Tumbling down 
All around
I wish I had another set of eyes 
To lose myself in 
One more time 

*Mirror me
And also you 
My mind

    





Simple Waters

Two great rivers
In different valleys
Wishing we could run together

    





Singing To The Same Sky

You sing your Iris and I’ll sing my Creep
Hum Yellow to my Yellow Lights 
So that all the night can see 
Such unchained, unchanged, melodies

    





Sinking

Nothing makes my heart sink
Faster to the bottom of this chest called ocean
Than a clueless defiance
A disregard for the most basic
The most respectful quiet

    





Sinking Weight

Have you ever known the most of this?
Or the truth which is
That it pulls a young man by his feet
To the bottom of the sea
When he realizes that
She isn't thinking about you

    





Sitting Alongside Myself, Wanting Only To Create

Sit and stay
Until the clouds unravels 
Till the hot coals glow
And the night calls you back
Try and try as you may
To pull the smoke out of snow
And it will outlast your hopes
For a clearing of day
Though I would be happier still
If I were creating along thr way
Sometimes the quiet 
Is the creation of self
Sometimes all that you can do is just
Sit and stay

    





Sitting In The Rain With You There Beside (A Tanka)

Nothing has a name
More beautiful than green trees
Seeping like strong tea
Over stirring waters round
And quiet eyes beside found

    





Sitting On The Beach With You (for HePo)

The beauty of here
Is not me
Or that you can see
With the exactitude of what is
No, the beauty of here is you
And that you're willing to look at all
At this reflective, moonlit, sea

    





Sixteen

I look for you in the words of others
I wonder where you've gone, yet know

    





Skein (4LINE)

Twist and turn, our woven ways
Make gaps no more to close
Let death be the only unweaver of us 
Tied to myself, you’re close

    





Skiing in the summertime

A crashing motive 
Knows no fear
When downhill slide 
Demands intent 
And as intently as
His spirits ride 
Through halls of snow
And hard packed trench
He flies
Like bluebirds 
Picking fast
At the suet of life
And so the mountain beneath him
Speeds right past

    





Skin Deep, a Haiku

Beauty has no name 
Or surface questioning whim 
Like yours engrained in

    





Sky Thoughts (Six Lines of Nine)

The greatest mind above your clear life
Born in openness and bright alight 
Is the darkness within but a wink
Passing fast, her being free of time 
And with loving eyes obscured, the sky
(is she and looks out, not down on us)

    





Skyward Eyes

Gently 
Softly 
Almost sweetly

So the clouds are near to me
And to you as well 

Although we are not at this time
Standing right here or there beside 

How these clouds smile back as they roll by
And tell us both to our surprise 
That we are watching and watched over 

Since long before we each sought after
That distant star in the summer sky 

We are by ourselves and each other 
Mere reflections in such skyward eyes

    





Skyward Glance

Eyes upwards 
Turning clouds 
With rolling chin 
And a smile to the sky forever 
He grins 
At the vantage point of where it begins

    





Sleep Away From Self

Sick of myself
Doesn't speak to half
Of how ready I am for a few hours of nonexistence

    





Sleeping - A Fond Memory Past

Buried beneath the same old memories
     Are the papyrus and the paper scraps 

The kind which will be eventually tossed 
     Just to settle upon the winds of trash 

But even still in stillness found
     Like a dream born near in this reality to pass 

Though it’s a beautiful and ironic sight
     I am sleeping on your memory at last

    





Sleeping Cat

Curled up like a cat
Atop a spinning world of responsibilities 

Don't wake me from this weekend dream
I can bear the nightmare occasionally 

Instead, cut the lights and turn the fan over me
Breathing one final breath into this lifeless beast

You can expect me not to hear so much as a single sound
When the new day comes with an irksome, early, alarming scream

    





Sleepy

Where night ends slowly
And day begins most abrupt
We fend, waking up

    





Slightly Tired

I am weary
My eyes are wandering aimlessly 
My forethought having long since lost its ability to see
Anything beyond the warm bed in front of me

O' my old friend 
How I long and wish to return to you again 
To pass the day slowly away 
Until I am refreshed again and eager to live 
Outside of this abnormality 

Because I miss the normal visions I have 
And this, whatever you want to call it existence 
Is a much sleepier, far less enjoyable version of me

For I am weary 
And yet I want to be
Rested without having to waste my time 
Investing in the folds of sleep

This I know to be selfish of me
And yet no matter how hard I try 
I cannot seem to close my eyes and rest my head
At either the foot nor head of my bed

Perhaps, if you'd see me, you could understand
That I am not angry, foolish, or sad
I'm just a slightly tired man

    





Slight Turn

With mind turning ever slight 
Hands on the wheel
And no arm of yours in sight
To be wrapped around this old arm of mine
I will drive on out 
Into the night 
Into the unknown of the next good day 
As I praise his name 
And drive on by 
With a questioning mind out loud in my 
Ever turning inward sight

    





Slyly

A slight smile by the side of my face
A wrinkle, a ripple in place to see
Beneath the surface
And to trace the essence of the has been me

    





Small and Indicative

In peril elsewhere I may be
Or not
And yet
Here
In this quiet place
You may find 
A small piece of me
And my quiet mind

    





Small Minded

If you mind
Their small mindedness
Their mindlessness
Will become the beast which kills the creative genius

    





Small Minded, Self Toil

Fell beings are we
Who delicate our time
Not to those causes which are above us
But to the strength of arms
And the will of the mind
For our own success
Do we see it, whatever IT may be
Though

    





Small Waves

We are but stone stirred ripples atop the lake of the all knowing. 
Ever flowing, ever moving, always steady, always growing. 

Stretching out like the limbs of an overhanging tree. 
Reaching out like the hands of the lovers lost at sea.

Desperately, we being again, in the shallows we are saved. 
And yet I am cautious to advance upon an overlapping wave. 

I am in awe to understand, that I am asleep, and I am a wake.
And no one ever knows the impact of the ripples they create.

    





Smile (:

No one sees me when I smile 
Wider than my eyes can bear 
Cooler than the coolest spring
Which you could find within this muggy summer air
Because when I grin
There is no sense of urgency or care 
There is only me and my eyes which crease 
Like folded paper flying through the humid air  
For my smile is this
Not because I wish to hide it
Or even because I overly care
But because my purest form happiness 
Is only seen when not prepare 
Alive and well in its natural state
Most often outside and always wide 
Something you might see across my face 
As a representation of what's inside*
(:

    





smooth hands, smooth stones (felt)

to hold your image (in my mind)
is more difficult than I could know,
or you, could even begin to search,
[let alone find]

to hold a hand (once not your own)
no self can lend a moments peace 
when searching for a hold in stone
[a fragile piece]

a gift is not always to keep 

mhmm...

    





Smooth Jazz

When I listen to jazz
Hot like seeping tea
As it cools like coffee directly in front of me

All I see is the ocean
All I hear is the swishing sound of the sand being turned to glass
Beneath the feet of an unwalking rhythm

Unwaking and amiss
Good jazz doesn’t walk a straight line as this 
It’s a drunken rhythm and a deep sip 
In love with the indescribable, naturural, eternal bliss

    





SMSR

Hopeless I would not call my romance
Too hopeful perhaps in the face of most 
Plainly
<strong>I want, who I am
Who do I desire?</strong>
Perhaps, no state
But someone who cannot refrain
Alongside such
"Sun, moon, stars, rain"

    





Snow Globes

Every human has a world locked inside of them
And the eyes see the snow globe
When it shakes, and when it falls
And when the internal wind swirls and blows

    





Snow on the rails, a Haiku

Ache consumes me through 
Like snow melting on the rails 
You saturate mine

    





Snows Song

The sound of snow is a beautiful thing
Catch every snowflake, you could not
But the earth can
Like the marching ants in the fruitful spring
Snowflakes need not tiptoe through the house of winter
Instead, they patter a song to sing on the frozen ground 
And we, as humans are helpless to stop it from falling down
With tiny little pinprick sounds 
The reign of winter falls all around*

End of storm 
Beginning of season

    





Snow Storm

Regarding the snow
I hope we get hammered
I hope we get hit

I hope that the wind just blows and blows
Yet cannot decide which way to go
When carrying for us the blessing of snow

How I hope to get home 
And get off these roads
Be it into a ditch
That way for a moment
That way for a bit
I would be left alone
Be it just for a minute

And if you're smiling now 
Then you can relate to this
So get going dear related
Before the roads turn to slick

How I hope and hope with an honest heart 
That we would see storms
 Of magnificent art
Capable of incapacitating the means to work
At least in part

    





Social Lows

The hollow, empty, fickle words 
The accounts and all of the time there spent 
Social media is the death of all things good and decent
I say again
Social media is the death of all things good and decent

    





Socialness

Though other introverts may shy, I will learn to appreciate such things. 

I will link experience to metaphor, and liken this noise to the birds which sing. 

Some unaccompanied, and some with voice. Some with the lyr atop the strings. 

I learn this though its not in nature. We humans are such fascinating things.

    





Social Stitching

Pointed, sharp and searching, ever in. Some people are needles and I the thread. Integrate me if you must, though I will not be sown of my own accord. I would much rather spin in perfectly spooled schools on my own. Thus, is the nature of the singular thread, alone. Sometimes seen. And sometimes integrated in both step and social seam.

But to the occasional social seamstress, sure.
Cut me in.

    





So It Feels

Although I often try and speak
In subtle tongues
I have no other language than this
Or so it feels
At times it feels

    





Some Known Quantities

Competence known
And with confidence found
Standing personal, leads to an exuberance in person
Like new flowers which will never know the ground

I don't grow on change
I thrive

    





Some Minds Are As Oceans

Puddles dry
Rivers run
And streams run out of present being
But the Sea 
The Sea is ever relentless 
Older than time 
And no less in never boiling need 
Be it all too deep for me
At the ends of the earth
It is one of many seas waiting for me

    





Someone . Else

If the fear is greater 
Than whatever intreage you once felt
In passing looks like days now spent
Then a week of me would never change
These months of unbeing 
Let alone those years spent with Someone .
Else

    





Something In The Eyes (FLY)

Every time she looks on him
Every time she reads what was his 
Every time though he tries and tries 
It’s every time she makes him fly

    





Somethingness

The bare earth
The scratched skies
The predictable people midst their ponderous lives
And I live to see them over time
As they progress towards somethingness
Towards no outcome which will leave any of us 
Alive

    





Song For The Stormy City

Though storms may come let songs remain
Despite the cites firm embrace

Take photographs to pass the time
As I do wait and part the glass which separates

The scraping skies and flying wings
Both above and below the shallow sea

Let us walk beside the crashing waves
Just you and I, to smell the air and sense the breeze

That we might once again be free

    





Son Of David

My eyes fill with oceans
My mouth healed with humbling salt
When I hear the goodness of the psalmists voice
When I read his song

    





Son of Sun

Somedays I'm the orphan
And others
I'm the imperfect avatar of the world in shining
All of its smiling glory

    





Sorry

You’re a hole in the ground
When I’m looking for a break in the clouds

    





Soul Friend At Sunset Beach

Meet me there
Where the beach is tall and blonde and nearly as fair 
Where the sun kissed sidewalks are more forgiving and free
Holding warmth more unpretending than those who never cared 
And the night breathes life refreshing back into our chests with a bellowing swing 
Where we sing with campfire sparks in the dark 
And look only to see the stars 
Staring back down into our eyes alive
For as high as we are on this lifeguard stand 
Meet me there my soul friend
I will be with you again
Above within the tepid air

    





Sound I Am To Be

You cannot see me
Hear aloud
Though here I am regardless

Consisting of the why in wind
Though I may howl
And crash upon the sudden leaves

I am still 
The whispering in the hear and now

    





Sourness

Sourness escapes my lips, 
Pulling tails around my waist, 
Into my oldest shoes I slip, 
Italian beasts from a bygone age.

My eyes are full of nothing today, 
That is except for weariness, 
And perhaps a little tiny streak, 
Of something resembling  belligerence.

My clock was screaming out dismay, 
And I displaced it on a whim, 
Desperately searching for a way, 
To snooze until a different day. 

But no sirree that couldn't be me, 
Because this morning I believe, 
That I've too much reliability, 
To let such sourness ruin me.

    





Southern Storm

So you think my storm is done at last?
Just watch and wait till summers end.
When, with a quiet rumble I return.
As a single jar of lightning left.
To speak the words of thankfulness.
And to spark one more glorious storm to pass.

    





Spark To Light

No shining star in the distant sky
Nor headlight glaring in your eye
Or a firework after it learns to fly
Can compare to the light in a man's heart
When he kisses his girl for the first time

    





Speaking Words of Wisdom

..Hug the world and..
E   M   B   R   A   C   E
You don't have to love
Lose your steadfastness
Or even change the un
Be true and moral, grace
Tolerate, don't cheat or hate

    





Speechless

You few, who, make me want to leave the windows open. Just to breathe the same air, and to sing the same breaths of somethingness.

This midnight me.

Wishes.

    





Spilling Words

Where does the desire come from?
To send someone words on a paper screen? 
Where does the inkwell saturate, and settle deep?
Mixing until you’re your dammed up thoughts
Break loose and spill out onto the ground
Flooding the valley at hand below
For when you spill yourself onto a page
You need to be comfortable with the mess you’ll create
It’s inevitable
</em>But why should you worry about that anyway?* 
I mean it, I say this with a laugh but…
Does any of this matter anyway?
Why should you withhold and hold back?</em>
The rushing words 
The kind which actually meant to be swept away

    





Spinning On

The world spins ahead
Spins underneath
As my own head turns 
There in time with the earth 
And tears itself apart in search
Of being what quiet serenity can be
(And whatever personal tranquility is)

Though previously known
It had to of been
And madly I go on therein 
Beside my own self being in hope
Of my old returning self to be
Full and mildly free
Of this hope built upon hope itself

That I am not spinning, it's just everyone else

    





Spinning Rains and Storms

And then one day
   When the sky’d had enough of it winded and vitriolic shame
With eyes wide as well mouths 
   Looking down from the most inhuman skies abound
On that one day
   When the world wouldn’t stop for even a second anymore 

It rained

    





Stained Heart

You taint my eyes,
You stain my heart.
You turn me like a bottle of wine in the darkest cellar.

You sound like me,
So quietly we drift,
Like the tides apart.

Like a somber tune for a sober sight,
Devoid in fact we are the light, 
The tinder waiting patiently to spark.

With only the trees to reconcile,
Dark is the shadow at the back of your eyes.

And yet gentle are your fingertips,
As you caress the quiet strings. 

Like the whims of the willow and the harp.
You color my tainted tear stained heart.

    





Standing By Self

Is there truly strength in knowing?
I used to think so, so knowingly
When really the strongest person
Is the one who does know, doesn't run
And doesn't worry about such
Knowingly

    





Standing Corn

Somewhere in a meadow
Beneath the rows of fielded corn
Between the sky, above a water way
Where a million tiny ears are born
And listening to the winds of voice
To the cackle of crows driving away a hawk
Living there, somewhere amongst a meadow seeded
Are a thousand, growing, listening stalks 
All born to stand, but not to walk

    





Standing In The Rain Tonight

Open my mouth to raindrop thoughts 
Forget to breathe the breath of life 
And I forgot
As I tried to consume the sky again 
For not

    





standing-still

disparaging, 
is the discovered place. when a friend moves on in a walking fashion, and your feet, unbudging, with all of their reserved and well-padded soles, 
remain

    





Stand Up To The Night

You think I’m scared of you?
Oh timeless fear

Of your taste for light
Which gnaws at stars
And nether years? 

Well I’m not

I’m indifferent

Staring without impudence 
Into the moonlit eyes
On metal roofs
Where feet can fly

I need not hold or soil with soot
My hands to cup the sky 
As is, as it wished

No, nameless fear
I fear you not 

But to challenge me with ferociously
Just try and see
What becomes of truth

When you tell me I should be afraid of you
Just to terrify the mortal in me
Just try and bend my eyes away
From the first new sight of another day
And I’ll break your iron will in two
With my indifference

Try as you may 
Your power holds no heavens over me

As a broken line of sight is free 
From the abiding night which is stripped away

With dawn come every newborn day

    





Starlight Fast

Tears for clouds
Snow from eyes 
And shines 
Oh the outpouring of light in your luminous eye
And your mind, your mind
Like a scintillating star in the night sky
I blink
And like a shot like in the dark
You pass me by
Quicker than the realization of time and light combined

    





Starlight Over Oceans

BLACK
Is the darkest singular star
Behind the sun in the known night sky

BLUE
Is the sea in the sight of it's beholder
And long as the day is young and green

BOLD
Is the order of man unknown
Tall, as it shoots and sparks into the fall of being

COLD
Is the starlight and seabed alike
As awakening grasps at the spark of meaning

    





Stars, and evenmoreso

Living between, caffeine and sleep
Is like pulling the moon out of earth's orbit,
So that the galaxies can finally dance,
And the stars can be entertained
Glowing evenmoreso with wine and cheese

    





Steady

And then suddenly you are there
And someone has come out of nowhere
And changed your life
For better or for worse
You are changed…but not me

    





Steady Beat

Though a billion others 
Like a drum beat sound
I say here stay
With words found between hand and head
As it's trapped between
Tried, tied and true
And so it is a subtle sound
Which beats ever longingly for you

    





Steady Passion

I pick you up, 
Ever so gently. 
And lift you onto a chair in front of me. 

Taller than me now you are,
And on my toes I have to reach,
To greet your face.

Most quietly,
With enchanted eyes,
And steady passion,
I kiss your cheek. 

Not once but twice,
So that you might know, 
The boy I’ve been,
And the man I’ll always be. 

The present standing in front of you,
The past surrounding most of me.

No one to witness,
Or tell the tale.

Or even explain,
Why I love your cheeks.

    





Steaming Tea On A Windowsill

Tea
Wisps of steam
Arise from dead leaves 
To grace the presence of my windowsill 
And the snow
How it blows and falls between
My future and me
But in the immediate reality of me 
Is tea

    





Steel Heart (for Pittsburgh)

Build me like the city streets
Strap my bones to solemn steel 
And give me an expression without inability 

Prop me up like the towering buildings 
And bend my back to the labors of industry 
So that I might just understand 
What it means to hear the steel heart beat</em>

Let these words go out from here and heal
Let these voices reach and touch the meek 
Let the rhythm within my soul preserve 
And the minds amongst us finally meet

So that we could savor a moments peace
So that we could pad the snow laden ground
And meet where the steel heart slowly beats</em> 

For we are the blood within which seeps 
As we rise to the surface quietly 
Teeming with life and full of desire 
To actively ponder and passionately seek

To understand the truth within 
For we are a vessel most unique 
To reach the travelers of time 
And to mold such minds as they do sleep 

For anytime such blood cells meet
The steel heart surely can be heard</em> 
In unison with every beat

Be it underneath these city streets
Let such an expression be heard by more than me

    





St. Elmo's Fire

What fire is this? 
Within your eyes
Like a ball of light
Gently caressing the ominous skies

Are you an omen to match my sign?
Or mere bones to cast in an empty cask?

I only ask because so many heads 
Have turned away from this overcast
Just because of your fire

That hopeful passion
Which pulls each sailor slowly on
To survive another night until the dawn 

To wonder if this your purposful fire
Is meant to bring us back 
To the very thing which we ought to desire

Away from the devouring grave of the sea
To a house made of stone on the inland maybe? 

Where are bodies would find the true solace of earth
And just might be at peace far away from the sea

Perhaps Saint Elmo
That is exactly where you wish us to be?

    





Steps

Everyday 
I'm going to take 
A step 
Further away from her
Until one day 
I'm in that good horizon 
And she 
Is wherever I was back then

    





Steps (or the lack thereof)

Don't step to me or dance in bare feet
Climbing ladders to try and see my eyes
Or mountains to find some semblance of my breeze 

I'm taller than you, but not by birth
Or by choice or selective meanings, no 

My style is tall and trim and sleek
Sharper than steel and whetstone combined 

"Where" ask, you've been seized? 

I am the stars you cannot keep
The ocean sands you could not settle
And no such gift is equal to mind

This is me (in step)

    





Stirring Memories Beneath The Sea

Pieces of you scatter and sway  
       With every footstep underneath 

Like a string of steps beneath the sea
       My hope is silt 
       And my thoughts are of you

Though the tides may turn 
       On a direful coin
       As they press for only the most history true 

It’s forever in memory and in mind
       And in the quiet corners of my conscious mind
       Where you will be 

Drifting like the sparkling sands
       Are the memories of you renewed

    





Stirring Mind

I am not a stream
Nor a babbling brook
I am a pond with a passing ripple
A sinking stone, thrown, once shook
With a shake often and aware of it
I am never content
With the soft waters unbroken
As a stream I am not known

    





Stomach Of Steel

The strongest steel 
It splits my chest 
And it feels good again 
To be good and strong

    





Stomping The Old Familiar Ground

I used to write here 
Craft in these corners
Scoff at these walls
Scratch at the stars, like a lottery ticket, when the world was young
When my own structures were seemingly falling apart
How I laboured without toil
Spinning spun without thread 
How tired was I, as a peice of myself, with leaps and bounds from cloud to cloud
When I was no older than the dirt beneath
How the tired me, trod this distant ground into my own history
Until it was more familiar and resound
In memory, as it is now

    





Stones

Like a piston in an engine
Like a jet in the sky
Like a trebuchet once, twice, always described
Like a whip uncurling
Like a stone once rolled
I am always tossing, always turning
Life itself into the unknown

Always throwing stones

    





Stones In A Riverbed

The warmth and roundness of me.
Is only there due to the edges taken off by you.

    





Storm At Seas End

Slashing orrs
in the water 
beneath the Moors
and bitter limestone tombs

Crashing waves
run smooth beneath
the ruptured wood
for a second or two

When all around
is breaking chaos
in the land of turning
there is no room

For fear of breath
this watery beneath
for the moments chest
to beat the gloom

    





Storms Create

Though storms rise on tempered seas
They stir the sand to glass
The oyster pearls
The time to pass

    





Storms Don't Change The Sea

When the sea calms after a storm, it is easier then to see. 

But you should never forget what the sea is, what it's meant to be.

    





Stormy

The wind in the trees
Blades of grass catching raindrops
And you in my ears
All of these with an open mouth
I hear
I breathe
I still believe

    





Stormy Lights

In the hours after

When the rain falls slowly beneath the stormy lights

When the only omission left is a sigh

And the duration of a breath has passed 

I'll know then by

Where we stand within this life

And what was meant, therein, hereby

This is not my town

But must I try

    





Strike True

A lance is such a different thing
In a different age
Perceived by those who turn and ride off, away
But best?
What is the best way in modern day?
To avenge unrest, to strike and sway
In a time when the world throws words away
Catch truth and cradle it in trust
Till the strike rings true
Till the passive armor falls and is stripped away

    





Strings By Fireside

Golden strings
Worn thin and brown 
Like hair once let 
From ponytail down
Around fireside
A plucking keep
A look by flames 
Ignites in me
A song 
A song 
To keep

    





Strumming Clouded Heart (A Haiku)

These clouded heart strings 
Cannot hum through air most faint
When in breathing out

    





Stuck

Cotton words
Well up in me
With wads of nothingness and felt
They glimmer and taste
Of a particular silence 
And like the businesses just down the street
Their hope it flees
They've run out

    





Stuck In Mind

Descriptive things
Entangle myself with them
Like fishing string
Bounced ***** of yarn
And poorly folded wings
I am unavoidably yours
My thoughts

    





Stumbling Through This Relational World

Which is the greater fear?
That you might 
Despite all of your wishes
Be seen?
Or that you will find something 
Once you truly begin looking?
My guess is that the truth of you
Lies somewhere in between 
Lost but found
Like coins in this fountain of being
Young
(For now)

    





Stupidity

I don't say this much, but that's stupid
To waste your life creating things for someone else
When really all that I create is to learn about myself
To understand the other half, of the other side, of the other me
And to create something so foolishly
And to think that it represents most perfectly
Whatever it is that I did see
That perhaps was stupid of me

    





Stupid People

There will always be stupid people wherever you go. 
And you'll always have to deal with them within whatever you do. 
Stupid people are unavoidable,
They're like the tides, ***** dishes, or the flu. 
But when you finally get to do something that you actually want to do. 
It won't matter quite as much whatever the stupid people do. 
They may be obnoxious or annoying, 
But that shouldn't matter to you. 
Because you're doing what you're doing, 
As compared to something you weren't meant to do. 
You see stupid people are everywhere, 
And they shouldn't influence you. 
Just let the stupid people go,
So that you don't become stupid too.

    





Stupid Questions

There's no such thing?
There is, you see 
As you walk into the room
Sit down with your little book of nothing
And stare at me demandingly

As if I know where the universe came from 
As if your words are those which deserves to see 
Through me intently

With your nose to the ground like a well-kept hound 
You sniff up my leg most intentionally 
When really
You are the furthest from the trail of truth
And you cannot even comprehend this loop
Which leads you around a thinly mirrored tree

So yes, every time I enter this houndtown 
I will laugh you upside right from down
 Until you bark with a tone more befitting your moan

There's no such thing to see
You see?

    





Sturdy Feet

Rolling hills
Golden fields 
Left to right 
Feet to feet
With every step
Through the wood
They stride away
Towards eternity
Into the deep
The unknown scene
Away from home
From everything
They’ve ever known
Or hoped to be
And with this step
One more has been
Further away from home before 
Than he’d ever thought he’d been
God bless your feet Samwise Gamgee 
Step onto the road and you will see 
The greatest adventure you’ll ever keep 
Burning alive within your mind alive
Until the in Havens you reside
And therein find the eternity you seek
For alive and well
You’ll ever be 
And beside the bearer 
You were meant to be
As a friend against all enemies 
And the second set of sturdy feet

    





Subconscious Stories

Blank
Is the mind within the pages of these
The books of forever 
The eternal novels 
Which line the wall of consciousness 
But never open to eyes awake*

I could add more but you wouldn't believe me
Sleeping giant

    





Such Rain

Nothing makes me smile like a dark day
Like the heavy rain
Which openly berates the crowd
But smiles at me on its way down

As I run from my car
But not to hide
No I run from my car to get inside
Because I'm late as late can be
And if I had no responsibilities
I would let the time slip and slide away
Within such rain

I would trod the squishy flooded ground
And turn my head up to the sky
To declare my love for such a day 
And to kiss the open honest clouds

I’m struck by this
Isn't it funny how?
No matter how hard the rain may fall
Your thirst is never quenched at all
By the rain drops tumbling down
How silly are the people who frown
At such rain

    





Suddenly actualized

It's a different sort of thing to feel
To go from one to another
No longer constantly 

But to suddenly see
All of your fanciful dreams
Just as what they are in the light of day

Then you know what has been
And what will thankfully never be

And then suddenly you're free
But not in the way you'd imagines

Let alone in the time-frame

Yet you can finally see

    





Summer And The Night

What depths could I describe? 
What sights have you not already seen?
What could I possibly tell you that you haven’t already heard from the whispering trees? 
The warmth of summer
The shimmering gleam of the frigid stars 
With stream water splashing about your feet
What cooling sensations could I possibly bring
To a heart such as yours  
On warm nights such as these

    





Summer Ways

Eternal summer
Stretching out before us both
Before us all 
Like a tempered path or a winding road 
Before us now
Like the direction in we each must go
Away from one another 
Perhaps
Walking slow

    





Sunday Last

Like the hazy screen
Projected off the fog and green lights of a Sunday night

I am en route to you
Always

Although sometimes stopped
At a red light

    





Sunrise Fling Tanka

Steady shadows wince
At the sunrise smiling wide
Seeing it's lover
Saying casual goodbyes
To it's famed fling named goodnight

    





Sunset, Lovers Torn, Tanka

Cool blue turns calm dusk
To hopeful still and quiet
As warm well lit dawn
Arrives in full force of arms
To carry tired lovers torn

    





Sunshine On My Writers Chair

And so I sit here in the sun
Not to shine
Or call
Or to warm
Or hum
But to reflect

    





Supreme Power

Clear my mind oh sovereignty
Untwist the roller coaster which I've built up in my mind
And make it straight as the mountain tops 
Which you created in the olden days

For I am weak and weary from my own insufficiencies
And I need your light within my life
In order to illuminate the coming day 

Would you clear my mind oh sovereignty
And bring me back to the same old street 
Where I used to walk as a child, be it still sinfully
I'd pad left and right with my childish feet

Would you clear my mind once more for me
So that down your path I may once more see

    





Surrounded By Trees

Old buildings weather youthful storms 
And trees bear more children than we’ll ever know

Humanity is not a curse 
But a whisper down an empty hall 

No shadow lies without intent 
Or climbs beyond a human’s back 

And though we bend and break with age 
We are born again just to take it back 

How needlessly we weave between 
The bitter roots, the grass and trees 

Sit at the base of life content 
And remember all which you’ve seen 

Because we leave our better trees 
To depart the earth into the soil  

And though we hope to forever stand 
No building will ever endure

No, in the end 
We all will break and fall again

    





Surviving

Life is meant to be a conscious thing
Though we constantly surround ourselves with those things 
And people which we do desire
In an attempt to order and forget ourselves
The foremost point of life is consciousness
And therein, the ownership of self

    





Sustenance

Life is grain broken
Barley thrashed and pulled apart at the seams of bread and beer
 
Grapeless wine 
On tender loving vines in a budding vineyard still

Intent on being our sustenance from the start 
Such things are born at the hands of man but by the will of Gods kind heart

Taco Dreams

Ideas
Really good ideas
Are like dreams asleep

Take melatonin 
Eat a pickle
Try as you may 
To recreate 
And force them into wakeful being

But you cannot
Not matter what you do or do not eat
As they will only visit
When your conscious mind is at ease

Unaware of hunger or self indulged feast 

Or you could try tacos
Tacos always give me dreams

    





take a taxi

When my channeled radiowaves groove
 and reach your ears like LEDs
(and in mind's eye explode)
with colorful remnants of unimposing
ultra all-knowing, unimportant dues 
You will want (if anything)
to pick up the phone
 and (to no one in particular) call
 and take a taxi beneath the moon

    





Talking on my own

No amount of silence
Can fill the void
Of which and in which
Would live the presence of yours

No song to last
Or calling bell deprived of joy
Cast in iron fast

Your voice

Leaves me hungry and listening
For this tension to break
Like the fast between these many hours

I wish 
That such a sound
Was known to these walls
And echoed all around

And that these talks were not just me alone
And of my own

    





Talking To Noone, Amongst Everyone

Space to think less
Space to be more
That is what your coffee shop means to me
And no matter how tempting the owner may be
It's is no such she who I adore
But the absence of the former self
And the discovery of what is meaning more

    





Tall

When you're tall
    You unfold like sunlight
    Stretch like silicone 
    And unwind like the outstretched cobbled road

When you're tall
    (and you apply yourself)
    You become something else

    You don't just gain a strength masked dangerous, no

When you're tall 
    And you have conscious opportunity
    You grow

    





Taller Still

I have always been a shadow tower

With arms of bended steel

Love me, hate me

Do with me your opinion what will

But never will I change as this 

Or let my shadows lack therein

The will to see it though and thru 

And deliver it with a furious will

    





Tall Golden Trees

Jet and handsome you'll never have
With eyes as dark as treebark
Hair curled and seasoned as the leaves
But I can tell you what you will have
You'll have everything he never had
The gold afield, the blue of sea
The tallness as a yew of trees

    





Tall Man, Silhouette

Edged like a brick wall
With a black hole post explosive heart
And ink drop shoes
Matted hair torn apart
Standing tall on the horizon
Like an exorcism
Postscript 
All the lights put out
Down the shadowy hall
With an outline fierce 
Jagged almost
Edged like a brick wall
Standing tall

    





Tall Trees

The great woods are 
But a memory to me
Of a time when my words clung to the branches of trees
Before the fall
Great indeed for their inherent value
For their intrinsic worth
Were such words and such times to me

    





Tangent, Wishful, Desire To Know

Desire of being
Give me your name
And a photo to match so that I can see past
The flatness of this absent meaning
Give unto me 
Please
Be

    





Tanka Of Talkative Nothings

Humans, we are who
Being of sound voice and full 
Speak often not of 
And more so now than ever
Of that which is nothing new

    





Tanka Of The Untamed

How you fire fury
How you freeze ferociously
A vein of lightning 
Running ever furious 
Never to be kept, but free

    





Taste The Sky

The air is colder there at night
Don't let me forget the feeling</em>

The sky is bitter like the darkest chocolate
And bitter still at me for ever leaving

It was only yesterday that the grandest sky stretched out before me
Ever high

Be it breathing down my youthful neck
Don't let me forget the feeling</em> of why

*Don't let me forget the feeling

    





Tattoo

Your honor is written on my arm, 
It walks with me through every day. 

Beside and through the sharpest thorns, 
Your ink will never be stripped away. 

Engraved within, beneath my skin, 
Your color my veins a certain way. 

For you are the honor upon my arm, 
And on my arm there you will stay.

-SS

    





Tearful Rain (first love)

We love the rain
Not because we can hear the sky
But that we can see her thoughts

    





Tearing down the doors of time

There is nothing there
In the place once where
My heartbeat did beat 
And my kick-drum rolled
Like a stone turned southwards 
To avoid the winters writhing cold

Breathed out like snow, the snow
Which falls first as a rain soaked hope 
And freezes slowly along the way
No longer pretending to know 
What the feeling of light falling 
Is like being beneath

Yet in the stillness, it is always me
Who knows no different than this when
Will my skies return to the lightest gas
And my head stop fasting 
On this memory of you
But a massing cloud just waiting to pass

And in the wishes of spring
Therefor hope once grows
And in the kind of snow which smiles evoke 
Which will never come to settle on the wings of crows
But glows in the sun like a radiant pyre 
And flows like the flame of a dancing wildfire

Ignited, I fly
And maybe then try
And shake the snow from my wings of this healing age
I find, and will hopefully allow my heart 
To finally come home
Who am I but alone?

    





Tennis 

It's electric friction beneath the feet
Like stockcars locked on the inevitable path
Matching until meters burst
Exceeding the limit and flying off the track

With powerful pinpoints and frustrating fault lines
And the breaking of makeup on the skin most bold

It is a poker face across the way 
And the frustrations of knowing that the crowd turns cold
Whenever you've failed to play perfectly within the fold

Tennis
Is the realization that you are IT, and all that which influences the bouncing ball

    





Tess

Her waist a stone laid wall I know
Beside a path walked quietly in the dark

With hair sudden like crashing waves
Informal as a Christmas morning
Full of lights, full of sparks

Persistent as the cattails in the northern breeze
Steady as the trees
And cool as stars, almost unreachable, untouchable
Unbearably far
  
Yet softer than the flowing mane 
Of the mare untamed 
In distant field that was once up close 

With a breath of steam for a cold grey world
Hang on through mortal comatose
And wake

    





That Certain Autumn Look

Rich and dark, like apple cider on an October street corner
I didn’t know you, dulcet and sweet 
Until the full weight of your intoxicating world washed over me

    





That Certain Whipping Wind

As the wind whips through the valley, so do these thoughts breeze through my mind. 

Suddenly. 
Occasionally. 
Coolly. 

Contemplating you and then some, other someone, some other time. 

Steadfast and true as are the rooted trees of are. 

Not ours mind you. 

Though the wind itself is never so consciously on my mind.

You are. 
At times.
On mine.

    





That Damn Coyote

There is a life beyond life 
a mere glimmer in the dark. And for me 
it can be seen 
(sometimes) in my 3 A.M. eyes.

    





That Howling Wind

Listen to the howling wind
Not a whisper in the voice of it
An embodiment of all the aimlessness
And the chaos which was once within
This heaving chest 
And beating heart
Which is now outside
Cold and lying bitter still  
And howling like mother nature had tanned its hide
Listen to such a wind as this
And you will understand what it is 
And what it means to be trapped inside such bitterness 
As the howling wind does speak of it

    





That Time of Night

Did you ever question why it is 
That I like to walk alone outside? 
Late at night and underneath 
The hailing Stars witch glow so bright
Do you ever wonder why that is? 
Perhaps because I won't let a roof 
Separate my thoughts from you
And the only way to send them through 
Is via the open air 
Which always seems to be alive
At that time of night

    





That Which I Built

You see this building? I built this building. But nobody knows that I built this building. 

I can only assert that I did build this building, and refresh my own memory of building said building. 

But at the end of the day, it's just an old building. And ironically enough, I've never stopped building. 

There are a few other people who helped build this building. Like myself they can say that they did build this building.

And even if all of our name were there on an engraving, it would never truly be anyone's personal building. 

Because we built it for those, so that they could start building. So that they could get going and build their buildings.

Because the framework we built was a structure of learning. And we each taught ourselves through the process of learning.

    





The Ache Behind My Eyes Explained

Don't tell me you were just a dream 
 That the skies you showed me were not bright 
 As dawn could eventually be.

And in growing day don't for a moment say 
 That our eyes were not brightened 
 By the sight of each other. 

That our time was not spent wisely in
 These discussions spanned 
 By the making of flowers grow again.

We power the world 
 We spin the tides 
 With just the understanding behind our different colored eyes.

Don't tell me you were just a dream 
 Now that my mind is certainly open wide 
 Like moons over the mountains high. 

The ache is a wish — would you let me stay 
 Just to wallow in this mirrored time 
 For a little bit longer by each others side?

    





The Act

Saying it isn't feeling it
And feeling it isn't breathing it 

Breathing it isn't living it
And living it isn't being in it 

Being in it isn't believing in it
And believing in it isn't seeing it 

Seeing it isn't abiding in it
And abiding in it isn't contentment in it 

And the act (therein)
Doesn't begin without the feeling of it

    





The Actor

How can you be someone else
If you don't know every side 
And corner of your own self
?

    





The Arrow

An impossible shot
Through cast iron ring
From incredible distance
And yet how is it possible
That she never misses?

    





the artist Indefinable

You're not captured in your paint,
compelled by stills,
or encompassed by song at all, my friend

No descriptive words can color your sky,
no sprinters length catch you without breath,
or fail to float the fly on the wind, no less

That is unless you let them say
what you are not,
is all you are, untrue

For you are the essence, embodied, reborn 
not what anyone else says 
or thinks they know of you

    





The Atlantic At Night

When I look into the sea
The dead of night midst new September
Staring back at me, I find
That I'm not scared
No, I'm terrified

    





The Beat Of A Heating Heart To Behold

When the fog finally breaks
    And the dayfever clears on bedded shoals 

My heart of sunlight beats again
    Like a vibrant wire,
    Far stretched between out standing poles 

There I am no longer on the sands of weighted cold 
    I rest in heat, my heart it beats 
    Like it did when the dawning days around
    Me were not quite so old 

You cannot coax me back into a fever
    Let alone a dream of for you
    When all of these clear skies are calling me
    To see a new light find
    And within it hold

    





The Best Team In The World

Power is gravity pulling you down
Till your feet meet reality cold and hard

Anger is nothing but a gleam of a crown
As you try and find your way in the dark

Just as speed can be blind without focus of mind
We are present, though it's not yet known what we'll do

But you'll hear the clout coming like a fire in the mountains
And you'll feel that same downward force once we are through

    





The Bird And The Fish

I’ll be on the mountain top* with the stars around my ears. My God to lift my life filled bones, higher than every tree and stone atop the slowly turning earth.  The embodiment of bird and sky, with word filled wings to bend the wind and to cut the currents of this life.  Like the westerlies, the blueish skies and the seas my father painted in my eyes.  

</em>And you will be in the valley below* with the same... foolish... guy.

Pity this,

But not you Miss Fish. 

Pity me for the try.

    





The Blacklist Question

The most dangerous creative question, is asked not in part but entirely in sum.

Plain and simple, black listed.

"You inspire me..." 

"But where do you get your ideas from?"

    





The Blonding Hair of Trees

A touch of gold caresses your hair
Yesterday's youthful exuberance
I cut a few locks from the world
And linger in your presence, still
Wishing only that you'd stay awhile
To bask in our mutual reverence

    





The blurred line between earth and sky, a tanka

Yawning breathes out sky
Inhaling questioning earth 
Breathless we will try

    





The Bookseller

Like a fish in water
He swims
Through rivers of paper
And shelves of public influence
To find 
The original place
Of every paperback not in place 

God bless this service
Thankless task

    





The Breeze Unseen

The world alone is not enough 
        It was never a shade of me

Though from the earth, the straw men rise and fall
        There also blows the breeze
        More beautiful than all once seen

    





The Builder

I have been focused and growing 
I have been strong
But now I see it's not the time 
Nor the place
To build you a house
Or a home in which I belong

    





The Changing, Aiming, Ever

We are not just aiming creatures, but also changing creatures
Ever moving steadily offwards
Acting only when we want to be, or time compels us to be more
Some think, some feel, some find their way in the formidable dark
Some ponder and abhor the sight
But creatures we are nonetheless, in ever undoubted outline 
Stark is our contrast 
Night is our eyesight 
And burning is our ambition bright

    





The Chest Clearing

A surgeon reaches down a path
And walks out with the heart of the woods 

Be it beating slow or beating fast 
The hikers pray
That the woodlot surgeon puts it back 

In the heart of it 
Where the woods still belong 

Strong...as they once grew strong

    





The Cliff of Loving Again

My barefoot sand 
And rocky outlook
Blinded by the trust in being
Feels beneath
And over the edge
Of falling for you once again
From the feeling of this am I
No longer fleeing

    





The Code To My Eyes

Pinwheel, 
Clock work, 
Chronoshift me into blue. 

Skyline,
Ocean eyes,
Color me a different hue.

Liquify,
Shatter me.
Meld me out of broken glass,

Enter me,
Exit please,
Fore the present comes to past.

    





The Color of My Heart

Depends upon the day, the place
The amount of light through the southern panes

Based upon the subtle shades 
Around my neck and through my veins 

Rolled up like sleeves, a comfort to me
With a crisp cold lip and a floor wiped clean 

Oh, yes
There is no step close enough to see

But it depends upon such things as these
The none, the less, the purpose of me

    





the confines of fear

Fear not the going
Of the when or bitter where, even
Though I will miss the smoothness of the stone in hand
And the smell of the earth after the rain soaked air is depleted
But I know it's true, because it is
Because when has the journey ever not lead somewhere
When has the worry ever been worth the wear 
When you are free you are in being
And have been 
Because fear is not in the going forward
It's the failure to begin

    





The Conflict

How is a young man
Intent in mind
To introduce himself
Again?
And yet
For the first time?

I ask of you
But only me
To hear the question
Internally

How is a young man
Supposed to be?
So forward as to ask <strong>of you</strong>
To spend any amount of time **on me?

    





The Creators Created

Makers will make 
And create the most marvelous things
For their loved ones to enjoy
And for their own purposes purposed 
To be found

But I do not make
Out of brick and stone
Out of mortar or meat or performance to the world of known

No

The worlds I create are within others
And through the stories of which
In their memories they
Will never be, or find themselves, alone

I build people
Not places

    





The day a page went missing

Tear out my heart like a missing page. I turn and turn to live again. 
Her will to read in nature's storm. Once born of being, is there and then. 
When your eyesight was ever mine to upend? Or to try and mend. 
You see? It never was once me. 
That is until your rain begins again. Anew.

    





The Deep

I am as calm as water with a corpse underneath. Because something is submerged, but I don't want anyone else to see. What I am struggling with, here within the murky waters I call deep.

    





The Deepest Realization

The real question is not
“What will they do for me, once and when?”
But throughout the years 
Throughout the struggle and the turmoil
Which is this human existence

I ask of you 

“What instead have you been doing for them?”
To prepare yourself for this honest moment
In order to give something back 
Instead of just having hallow words 
To send and rescind

What then will you do?
When you finally understand? 
And stand alongside this  
The deepest realization known to man

    





The Deer Know Not Human

The deer, for one
Know better than to fraternize with humans
And their mechanistic ways 
With coffee and love and oil to burn
Les their own natural pattern be disturbed 
And lost
In our perceptive order and ignorance 
Of the ways of the turning world
Beneath our very feet
They'd better not 
Learn

    





The Distant Relationship

Happiness is the obnoxious cousin of Joy. And her not coming around often is a blessing, not a curse.

    





The Doer

Tonight I get to do what I was meant to do
To be who I was meant to be
And although every eyeball in every line of sight may be fixated on me
For an hour or so
That doesn’t change the fact that I
Was meant to step out this stage and to bend like a bow
As I did in the days of old
Such talent is still stretched within me 
That I should perform, and that I should play, most doggedly 
Until the finely threaded twine within my mind begins to unwind
And I am straight as an arrow hence
Laying on the table before, how I once had said
That I hope I can return once more for that again
But not for this I said
Not for this

    





The Door at the Foot of the Mountain

Where the trees arch over the road way 
And meet, just above the dusty street
The road which never was called upon to be modern
As the whirling winds and tempered dust stares back at me
This is where you will find my heart
At least for one week out of every summer
Lost among the wild things, and memories
Although I will never be as tall as such trees
I will try and grow, for more than me
The former me

    





The Dream of Unbeing

No Man or intuition 
Can see more than a day or two
Into her dream
Not weeks or months or years to spend
Instead all they think of is
"Wouldn't it be nice if"

    





The Drug of Nothing, A Haiku

Sleep is to unlife 
More than being is for some
Merely escapeism

    





The Earth In Love, Ingénue

White ivory
Tapping down grey city streets
On a sparking hill once wild and free

The earth in love
And her daughters eye smiling quietly
Beneath flowing hair and golden sunlight

Their countenance
Making Monday breathe more easily
With the promise of afternoon sunshine to be 

#Monday

    





The Earth, In Love With Sunshine

The sky doesn't ache for rain
So much 
As the earth
(In all of its cold rotational truth)
Aches for the distant sunlight burn

    





The Earth Is Not Human In The Least

One day when the cattails turn 
The clocks unwind themselves in silent sound 
And the sun stops smiling back at us

One day then, when the someday is when 
And there are no more daunting stars or crashing mountains 
Waiting to converse with gravity voice 

Day one without when will begin anew with a flower
Seeded in moonlight, born the son of Sun
And all that we did, even the observations will be undone

    





The Edge

Never again will you look down
There is only upward and onward to see

No more the feel of your stomach a flutter
Your eyes set afire and the shale beneath your feet

Oh yes, you jumped before this miserable me
But then again my friend

Any day I can fall from the cliff just like you
But never again can you choose your decent like me

    





The Effect She Has

You shake me, because of you. 

You hold me, not with arms available, but in captivation. 

You fear me, perhaps not because of me, but because of who I am becoming.

I respect you, not only because of him, but because of a gentleman's decorum.

This is... Nerve wracking. 

This is not yet... And yet more so for me. 

And I thank you for that.

But what is this for you?

Nothing perhaps. 

(:

    





the ending song

Heavier than water
More colored than caramel
I am a weighted stream             
A sap trees flow                          
And though in striking hope alight
A burst                                                
I am burning for no more than shadows dance
And in the ending song, I find        
That I am alone and for the worse

    





The End Isn't Nigh

Revelations isn't tomorrow 
I know because in knowing means, I don't 
Don't tell me I don't care for today
Or know what it means, when in reason won't
Fast held in gossip, I'm telling you this 
In the nothingness found only free
Don't sacrifice freedom of mind to less
And lesser things from revelatory such
Wants of being in the know you think
I know this so, in this so so world we do change but don't ever grow

    





The Endless Coming Of Undone

When everything is in order, set
And stones are smooth as rivers run
It is then, and in, I expect will forget 
The endless coming of undone 

But no 
Not yet 
For a hundred years more
I will remember, learn, to just let the coming of set 

No order will ever
Last

    





The End Of An Era

It’s that moment in the parking lot
When you realize that it’s all over
That <strong>the end</strong> is here
Your future is near 
And your present surroundings will not always be

    





The End of Earth, The Beginning of Sky

Where the mountians meet the sky
There is more sense and visibility
Behind all of these tree branches reached
Than in me

In this moment of there and then
When I'm caught wondering about life
And where my next meal will begin
Respect is built

And all that's left is the untimely hill
Which is yet to climb
Over my yesterdays self
To again is to try

    





The Envelope

Know not the turn of my cheek
The strength of my chest 
Or the way in which my mattress rests
Just beneath the sill
Yet in front of the envelope which waits for you 

Though you ought to know
That every line and every word
Was meant to be
In broken verse 
Just as it it

That way one day 
Only you could find me there within
And surpass the number set before
Thirty-two 

For I am my own
And none of her names
Though in idealism 
Perhaps a bit, one and the same

And should you never arrive by me
Then the envelope as directed will be 
Delivered to you

So worry not
But hopefully it will not come to that
And that I will live to see your face
As you learn such of things

Like the envelope without a name

    





The Etherous Wind

Don’t waste words on a hollow breeze
You have feet, have you not?
Use them against the wind
Walk or run as you please

    





The Eventual Tanka

Eventually
This truth be told to the world
Gray skies come for us
All beneath one and the same
None ever escapes from rain

    





The Eyes of Today

When I wake tomorrow, there will be no waiver. No wall or water to crest over me. When my kneck pulls my head from the pillow of bed, I will stare into the eyes of a newborn day, and challenge it with anew consistency.

Nothing...today...will stop me.

    





the fall is just tired dust

no amount of making 
  or feigned revisions of life unlived
    can recall a sighted sky over the ocean 
      or pull down a sunrise behind the mountains 

      better to try and catch the stars which aren’t stars 
    chase sleight of hand or tongue of minds unfold 
  let alone myself alone in this
I am tired of being cold

    





the feeling of impending now (tall)

This tall tower
Skyscraping master of one
Has a name and internal beams of rust 
And to see within at the embrace of time is to trust

    





The Feeling of Want

How quickly she forgot 
How poorly I expressed 
And either way
We are run away 
With the feeling of want</em> which may not keep
And will not if you ask the likes of me

    





The Feel of Your Holding Hands

Some days my heart sinks
And stretches out a hand to hold
Knowing that when it finally gets 
What it so often most desires
It will need more patience than it has ever known
And to grow more quickly than it has ever grown
When it was on its lonesome path alone
And yet somehow it still it wants to know

    





The Final Whisper

When the only whisper
Left in loved ears
Is wind
Then all will fall and flow over itself again
Yes
The final whisper is wind

    





The Fire In Our Human Eyes

Like New York streets
Colarado peaks
And Canada winters blowing slowl

Until ash ignites
And in three days burns
Like a weekend turning 
Until humanity is warmed to the bone

And so in seeing these how we often speak
Of pondering that which we do not know
But wish to of known for our future parts
And of a whole we hope to learn 
A little more of sights once let go

No memory ever endures

    





The First Sight of Fall

Through the trees it peeks
Like a breath of Fall
Caressing the mirror of Summers last look
Holding the eyes of all
Of the passers by
Who happen to look
And luckily happen not to catch cold
At the very sight of miss Summer
Growing ever older between two trees

    





The First Time You Speak

It's newfound lovers beneath the first starry night sky shared together

It's a child playing at the tail end of a wave, just wishing for a second longer it would stay

It's a moment consumed by a clockless mouth

It's the most pleasant forget which you can find within yourself

It is a passionate glory in a war without spears

It is the flowing rivers of song in communicative ears

And therefore in being, be it the evermore near

Such love at first words is all that you wish you could hear

    





The Fog

When I am ill
I’m not numb, I hum
With radiation everywhere

Far more aware of how tall I am
And filled with ache 
With stale, dull, air 

It’s like a flower wilted is
It’s like a moonlit night neath clouds
It’s like I cannot feel, yet all is feeling all around

When I am ill
And feeling
Inexplicably, down

    





The Fondest Feeling You Evoked In Me

I remember you
Your sound, your tempered speech 
Reading Pausch by the beach
You set me free
To smile again

    





The Former

Since I discovered this place
Since I took up that old mask again
To hide my boyish face

At least for an hour or two each week
I feel at home
Almost not alone
In a place where I may not belong

    





The Freezing Air Conditioners

To pull your sleeves down
In the midst of summer
Is not to fear the heat
But to aspire to be
The greatest form of indoor mind 
Which you could possibly be
So once they're at length
And at your wrists alive 
Don't worry
Just be
And don't freeze

    





The Gift

Love is giving when you're not comfortable giving 
The difficult part is both the explaining and understanding your own discomfort
Any lover can give when things are perfect
But it takes faith and trust to keep giving
And to truly understand the meaning
Behind the gift

    





the girl I breathe in

in sketch or smoke or clouded streak 
I just want another draw of you
(to etch and breathe)

    





The Grandest Ent (Yavanna's Tallest Son)

The sky above him layered in
Like waves upon the shoal 
And all the mountains knew his name
And he their waving roll 

The earth beneath his treading feet
Turned stones like mortal coils 
And all the footprints knew his path
And depth above the soil 

His shoulders stood above the trees 
A crown of stars his ears 
And all the shadows couldn't bear to see
Nor stand beneath him in fear

Beyond no borderlings he'd step
Unless his heart was called
And with him birds would often sing 
And perch on him their wall

As the waterlilies craved his touch 
So to mortality, he was bound
And then off the earth one day he walked
Never again to be found

But still the memories of mid-earth 
Hold fast in root and stem
For once a guardian walked this way
As a tree with a beard of men

    





The Great Investment

The greatest gift of all is time
Be it present or in invested thought
Be not offended when their style
Is not to your taste
Your mild mannerisms
Because if they, like you, were all one and the same
You wouldn't know your own or be

Just as the time without time is yet to come
So you should appreciate what's been

Founded in time
Is not waste
But times itself

    





The Great Pretenders

When you dont know who you're supposed to be
Or of yourself whatever was indefinitely 
Remember this
Nobody does
Ever

    





The Harmonica

I'll never talk about what it's not, but I'll tell you what it is

It's the jaw harps sound, clear as spring water in open mouths

It's an echo clear in a budding clearing

And clear enjoyment in the crinkling eyes of a crying wish

And as for my old mentor, his name was Kitten Lips

Because he purrrrrred when he performed on it

    





The Heart And Soul Of A Champion

Volley with the moon
A ball
.
Stretch as horizons
Stretching out 
..
Leap until the stars, your ears
Are all about 
...
And never fall
Push back the creeping ground 
....
When you’re tall, be tall
And strong 
.....
When your voice is alive with song
Sing loud
......
And when they say, your hammer strike has lost its might
Pour down a rain of blows like a bursting cloud
.......
Showing all the might and rush of youth 
In a Springtime unexpected so soon
........
No anvil ever lived without a thousand strikes 
Or snowfall ever cared for open eyes 
.........
Because where you see them looking up
Strike, with a forceful meaningful down
..........
As if we were never meant to be
Anything but alive 
...........
Arise, and find your former self
Awake alive, your hammer rise

    





The Heart of all Hope

You cannot compare yourself to them -- Be it anyone, sibling or self -- Because God cares not about the framework you desire -- Or the shape or the size of your house -- But God looks inward, with the truest intent -- So does man fail to see past the skin - Because God builds a house in the heart of all hope -- And that hope is where contentment begins.

    





The Honest Truth

I know when I am kept at length
I feel it still

The distance between 
The shortness of breath 
The memory of such

Did you know that such things never escape me?

Like the way in which you used to be
How you used to breathe 
So...openly

Just know that this change is not insulting to me
But speaks more firmly than any word
And more clearly than any crystal stream

So I need not ask if I may drink
I simply cannot
Nor am I capable of thinking beyond

For that is how you have made this to be
Quiet again
And short without sweet

And thus, I am left
Disappointed in myself
For sharing like this
So....unabashedly 

How I feel like a child standing beside a rapid river
Raging onward
How it runs and swells and passes by my confidence, quickly it flees

For in my mind comparatively
We were the same in prior days
Like a mountain stream 
Clear and crisp

But now, just know that I must learn to flow more cautiously 
In order to be and protect myself  
Remaining as is

For this is how it must now be
Directional, proportional
Or at least based on what I've seen
For therein grows a greater distance between 
And greater still 

And I will not pay
I will not suffer
When your attention in such moments
Is no longer free, to the likes of me

So here I lay the honest truth
In an honest statement, without plea

    





The Hopeful Flame In Mind

If left to my own ...
Fine devices 
ALONE

Without anything ...
But conflict
FELT 

I will not shine bright ...
Or glow by candle 
LIGHT 

But blow out the fire 
Of hopefulness 
COLD
...

    





The Horizon In Her Eyes

From the moment I first saw 
The sunlight fall
Into irises warmer than southern seas
All I could think about was how 
You are not my starlight
Yet in sky
But as another day ends
I'd like you to be

    





The Human Inevitable

Perfectly, flawlessly, lost
Still lost

Quietly, solemnly, sleeping
Still wake

Notably, publicly, making
Still waste

We are dying, arriving, and truly 
Too late

    





The Human Mind A Tanka (S7)

No god of grand heights
Nor the devils depth be mine
Know only stillness
When I let you rest never
For I am you and your mind

    





The Human Temptation

The duality of life
Of want, of business, and of busyness 
Is so tempting
So intoxicating to live
By human standards and spontaneousness 
For all of those sequential things
Which lead us to death anyway

    





The Inevitable

Never let it be said
That I took a bite too big to breathe
That I scorched the earth beyond repair
That I cut down every growing tree
That I delved too deeply into the questioning unrepair

Never let it be said
That time itself is now regrettably by
Or that I was never truly willing to try

Never let it never be said that my faith ever waivered, without purpose or reprise

Never let it be said that I said no more
Never let it be said that my breath will not end
Never let it be said I will not endure
Never let it be said that I was not of men

I was
I am

    





the ink

our nature is not inkwells
our tongues are pens
our will's to live

    





The Instive Memory

The nature of intensity is like an eclipse in the sky
Most memorable
Most vibrant
Most unique to others
But no less alive than the prior tries
No
The trick is in the duration
Just for a moment
A certain time
That is what in the mind’s eye remember
What makes the instive memory shine

    





The Introvert

Izaak is an introvert 
Izaak likes his room and board exactly as it is, so that he isn’t bored
Quiet in his apartment, just as he was in his dorm
But soon his people started telling him, more and more
That he needs to get out more
That he needed to go out an explore 
Just in case he ever should look back and wonder 
What exactly it was, like if he wanted more?
And so he tried and so he went, out into the world
He spoke and socialized
He brought, and bought and spent until he himself felt very spent and worn
Because Izaak is an introvert, and for the outside he wasn’t meant to be
Let alone to be reborn, and so
After all the stretching, the social pains, the growing norms, which were not wrong
Just different, he was both different, and the same 
And in his room, he was welcomed him back
Once again, to the walls of printed ink and paint which he himself did create
Because Izaak, did indeed need to see the differences within his own eyes
But only in time to better understand and represent 
The quiet life which he was meant to lead, inside 
Because Izaak is an introvert
And no introverted thing is ever truly a waste of time

    





The Introverts Wish

There's a great big beautiful world out there
Full of sights, and smells, and perceptive days
But to see it enough
Leaves me wanting to not
Being in it too much
Makes me wish it all away

    





The Irony of Youth Is Internal

True youth
Is like a window
Reflective found
Once realized
Which side of it
Are on
You?

    





The Jackrabbit

I am the jackrabbit</em> on two legs
The half moon hanging overhead
The eerie branches in the dead of night
And the midnight snack
On which you wish you might just be able to bite

    





The kind of writing which demands

There is a difference when
  A man writes to write
  When he is looking to be
  Or not

When he is drawn out slowly
  Or even enticed
  By similar thought

The difference wherein
  Be it seen or not
  Is available still in the smiling thee

In the unbiased quiet of wishing
  Of wells

And in the sky of an almost knowing singular hope
  Beneath wings of birds once free indeed
  Once driven from the land of having
  Or wandering into lost passages tall

Therewith burning fiery glowing alone
  You should know 
  That he does speak his own tone

And if he gives you these
  Such seas and oceans of well known
  Then be pleased

For it is you who he then loves alone
  Most ardent and true
  In an earthy word song definitively long
  And in the thought of throng, it is you alight
 
For there is a difference when
  A man writes to write
  And when he doesn't, he is wrong

    





The language of the trees at ease

What you see is what you find
And all that is found stretches out 
Before you like a flowing sea
Where water meets the grass so green
And trees overhang like homely eaves

Looking onward, openly
Towers look down like big brothers
Skies above stretch out to beyond
Horizons tall and foregrounds close
Close in on sounds of wandering on

The light it captures leaves so green
It fully expresses natures breath
And longs the father of all to breathe
It grows and flows and sings in trees
It whispers nothing comfortably 

With rustling, and questioning,
And gentle flying that's above
Like bees

No humming here yet can be heard
Except those song notes softening
Which cannot be seen

Everything that can be seen is blue
And all that lives above is not

With thoughts more vocal than the leaves
Which whisper psalms between the trees 
And cast down children onto cattails 
By the meadows pond of widowed ease

There is nothing in this something 
There are whispers on this breeze
Neath lilly pads above below
Twix fields of flourishing evergreen

A wish is lost in single breath
A butterfly flys beside this me
And climbs on whispy whims which flow
And lives only to leave

A fallen brown cascades to the ground
And rests on subtle grass limbs green

Outlined by brick and sanding stone
These waters whisper back to me
And creek and scream and visually plead
To be set free
By the crash and falling of a tree

But with no storms in sight
So all of this will continue to be
As clearly as this is today
As visibly as my eyes do see

And this is why I speak in poetry

A breath is not a breath without the breathing in, the hearing out
The loneliness of being alone
And the happiness of being free

From all the complications of the indoors
It is out in which I find myself most being

This outline of the trees look up
The blue line of the skies creep down
And ripples like the ponding pound
A note pressed without a single key

I love the way the sun seeps through 
The evergreens and sunken weeds
And finds itself on fallen branches
Tucked beneath the grass so tall
And tidied like the clearest stream

But above all else
The more I think about
This wondering, whispering, wispy, wild, whimsical, breeze

I know that it animates and brings to life all of these trees and all of these leaves and all that I see and I am wonderfully thankful for all of these

Please, would you hear it still?
Help me identify each and every one of these?
I know you've seen, just as I see
Where the clouds like to rest 
Just above the peaks of man made trees

And all I can see is these
All I can feel is the breeze
And hear is the song of ease
Which flows from nether trees and natures eaves

Please

    





The last day of summer always dies so suddenly

There is a day which always comes
Like a sudden storm at summer ends 
Like the echo of a drum 
No words exchanged or even needed still
No letters signed were ever sent
Since my youth 
The cold always begins without a word of truth 
And with a lie the warmth end

    





The Last Light of August

I've seen the golden light of Summer
Fading into the September black

Born like dawn in the daunting Winter
Warmer than the Autumn solstice splinter

Caressing my cheek
Like a long lost lover

On such dusklight
I will never turn my back

    





The Law of Reappearing People

I saw your substitute today
Where the stairwell meets the fleeting hall 
Passing me by, without a wave, without a smile 
I saw your substitute today
But she wasn’t the same at all

    





The Lights

Dark skies are not black
Just devoid of light like oceans deep

And stars are not light 
Just bright fires in the distant
Almost phosphorus sight 
Of the galaxial eye

And the fact that we blink
Autonomic compulsive reactive 
Shows that darkness exits
But only after for an instant flees

I call this, how things are

    





the lilacs never gave me a headache

reaching through my window grasp, my collar lined, my mind unfolded. pull me through this painted glass, the crown unmolded, and shape my day with glorious rays, with simple scents and lilac embolded. with the coming way, of every may, would you make my day most intoxicated, in such a simple yet glorious way?

    





The Listener

Listen to the rivers run
Your mind with far away

Hear the words of another lover and stay
Be it near or far away 
From all others

Focus on the one thing that matters
Until all other matter does fade

As you hark, attend, harken and heed
Be careful not to let the kindest voices
Waiver until they fade and let you slip away
From all others

    





The Little Things We Share

When I write
When you sing 
We embody the voice spoken long before
No words ever were or
First

    





The Location

Who knows where the heart of a man resides? 
In the mountains? 
In the sea? 
In an empty chest like cavity? 
Be it hers or mine? 
Because who knows where the heart of a man resides?

    





The Mere Sight

When I see you

My eyes turn to the side
Just past the wrinkles 

To the corners of the world 
Where the greatest hope still resides 
Besides that of eternity 

And you, you…

You seem to me
Like a picture of a jubilee 

As a lightning strike
Before my eyes 
You change the way I view the night 

And the days so short 
Which pass us by

Though your heart of Autumn
Often beats 
There is always summertime in me 

And the will to be
Alive

Yes, the mere sight of you
And the mind I see 

Always makes me feel
Alive

    





The Moonlight Neath The Hemlock Trees

The moonlight serene 
Looks both different and differently at me
Through these Hemlock wings alive
And the summer breeze perspective 
Flying above us with its free embrace
Whispers a painted picture of forest green 
Into your ears the essence of my dream
Of which you are of part and parcel 
A major reoccurring being
You, and this new moonlit scene

    





The Morbid Truth

Tell me I will last
   Anyone will last
And I will greet you with a laugh
   Mortal and cold
Like the dawn of each new day
   Every minute growing old
All will wither
   All will die
All will fade
   Will not last 
   Or outlast time
Truth be told
   Noone will survive the youngest youth
   Just as none will surpass the timeless old
This is the Morbid Truth
   I hold

    





The Mortal Second Thought

Words can never hold you
Like immortal arms can try 
Or comforting words can pretend to keep 
Everlasting as the books which fall short of life 

Much emphasis on this mortal can 
This inevitable, always, will try 

Humans, right?

    





The Most Balanced Haiku Today Tonight

Sunlight comes and goes
Most homely on daily edge
Where moonlight it doesn't

    





The Most Beautiful Thing I've Ever Written

The end
A poignant secret 
See

You're my type of breeze
The height of trees
Whispering in the arms of wind

    





Themselves Alone And Yet Not

One day I awoke
And in the mirror looked
Seeing not just myself 
But you as well
And with a smile we 
Went about our days 
As two halves can only be
Themselves

    





The Naked Egg

Comfy seats, yellow walls, hot coffee and Chai tea. 
Tall tumblers filled with ice, and faces warm, quiet and friendly. 
A rugged sign hangs just outside, to welcome those who are hungry. 
If golden treasure lies inside, this Naked Egg is such a treat. 
Now's not the time to question taste, you could pick at random for goodness sake. 
There isn't an item on the menu the wouldn't make most clean their plate.
Sidewinder fries await inside, a torte, a Florentine, a bean. 
The whole farm perhaps for your appetite, or a western omelet smoked with cheese.
New deli items await your taste, just choose your meat after a certain time. 
And if your cup is ever in need, they'll refill your teapot every time.
Don't be a hot mess, just order one, and you'll be happy that you've come. 
To be at the Naked Egg you see, is to see how flavorful life can be.

    





The nature and observer (her and him)

Wading through the seasons past
In a mesmeric dream and wanton flow 
Beside river of patience waning fast   
Beneath rain and snow and pollens glow
 
Don’t scream
Or cry
Don’t wake the trees
Their slumber makes the dry eyes smile

Just to hear the hum of thunder
The rumble of steam
And the distant buzzing of the bees
Is enough for me

I being still
Beneath growing skies of grey and blue
Like a wheaten field hope grows again 
And in growing there he waits for you

    





The Nature of Sound and Song

The best sound doesn't pull me from you
The best song drives me further into your arms
And creates a new look of understanding between us two

This is the nature of sound and song

    





The Nature of Wordz

We spend our academic lives...

-worshiping ours, or
-regurgitating someone else's

When words are meant to be neither of these.

    





The Next Eight Hours

He walks around all day and stays
With coffee veins and shining heart
And jazz whisking his head away

    





The Night Wire

With every ounce of darkness
There is a wire stretching thin
Taught as a corset on her skin
And waiting for the vibrations to begin
Beneath what ever it is within
And yet a lust for me is not inside
For my heart is never dark
But a mind of equal, high in value
Is never to be scorned or laughed at
Only ever to be desired
And looked upon as a necessity in part
When it comes to hearing out the other mind
In the quiet pangs of this good dark

    





The Ocean Is Writing

The ocean is why I wish to create 
Look at the depths 
Feel the weight 
When you’re lying on the bottom reef 
The pressure is immaculate 
And you cannot wait 
To taste the newness of each breath 
Surrounded by salt 
And the slow falling sand 
Like the snow of the sea
So the freshness in your eyes cannot wait 
To be both above and then below again
And that is why I wish to create
Like the ocean sands which are underneath 
And not like the hot sands beneath our feet

    





The Oceans Fate

Even rocks receive
Like crashing waves with a hope 
Such sounds, you and me

    





The Old Box

Today I dug and shoveled away, at an old box, at an old sin. 

And upon finding it, I opened it, and stared at its contents. The realization stored within. 

For inside I found the truth in this:

"That you can stare at the monster all you want, but in your future, don't ever let yourself desire his life, or become like him."</em>

Not ever, not once, or ever again. But instead be reminded of who he is and how he is. And why also, such things exists, within this life. 

Don't embrace the monster locked away. But be a better man. Be more than this. For that is the truth which I found in this.

    





The Old Man

Someday I'll be an old man
Just a note in my granddaughters calendar
And 
It'll read
 "Visit him"

    





The Old Man's Voice

Why would I spend any amount of time?
Trying to sound more like an old man?
When I’ll become one of them soon enough I think
And sound like them
It'll even be easier then because I just "am"

    





The Only Constancy Is Change

For every tree unborn
For every stone unturned
For every page in every book 
In every bindery which will burn
Quietly in the fires of industry  

There is death
And there is time
There is life 
And there is change

And there's also the light between the leaves which fades
Until it is out of sight 
And consumed by this
The lack of brightness within night

For just as acorn stems to tree 
So also you will see your growth
As tall as ever it was meant to be

So you need not worry about such things
Because the ink is dry 
The life is lived 
And the only constancy is change

    





The Opposite Feeling

She'll never know the way he feels, as he tucks her hair behind her ear. 

Just as he'll never know what it is she feels, when her hand finds itself on the back of his neck, between the ears.

Coincidence...

    





The Other Half Of The Moon

In case you ever wonder 
Where the other half of the moon goes (to rest)
It's on my chest
Just to the left
So long as I am under you and your spell

    





The Other Me

My feet a mass of broken blisters
My mind quieter than the sleeping trees
A thousand fireflies ignite in front of me
And I dance beneath a joyous clouded sea
Because I have forgotten the old me
I have forgotten the old me

    





The Ownership We Give

Time does not turn on a dime
No it scrapes
Like shoes on the asphalt 
Chalk on the slate 
Scuffee
Time is not time
When another man pays
It is a slow and mendacious 
Pain

    





The Passersby

When I ask, I ask
It's no longer in me, to run
As a young man no more
I walk, and will not stir from discouragement
Even when you choose 
You pass

    





The Path of a Pensive Man

Firm collar
White as snow

Crisp and with an edge like steel 
Cutting, not cold

Unblemished is he?
No

Considered rough, 
Perhaps 

Although in a certain way, he walks
Straight past his friends and his foes

Not aimlessly though 

For where poise meets focus
There is also dignity 

And a calming aura to be found 
Amidst the calamity 

With a hint of conflict
Though he speaks 

His words are bound
To fairness and justice
To the law and to love 

And though he spoke once
Not arrogantly

This is the sound of a constant man
Who is capable of change, and yet, is found

In a pattern which drowns out the breeze
Like the whippoorwill that’s lost its tree 

By this you'll know, that you've seen 
And crossed the path of a pensive man 

Intent on this, to understand 

Her
Him

And all around

    





The Patient

Temperature elevated
Lips sticky
And back curved with the slightest of pain
How I wish that I could kiss you now
Brush your brow with gentle cold
And take every ounce of your present misery away

    





The People of the Cosmos

Sometimes I’m in awe of the constellations
Of the planets and their unorderly align 
And other times I see the sun in its blinding light natural 
And am disgusted by its distant hiss and lurid blind

    





The Percolator

Wherever they are
Would you let these thoughts and dreams profound
Settle to the base of your stomach

Like that stray grains of coffee grounds
Not filtered through the thinness of society
But strained through the fibers of the heart

Ever flowing from the the mind
Until the truth is boiled down
And at the bottom of the cup found

    





the prominent role

How far does the waning songbird ring
How unheard of long the song which calls you home 

you know?

    





The Question of Life

The real question
Real struggle of life
 Is how 
You will live 
With it

    





The Realization

People forget how deep it is
Till the ocean looks back at them
Intently from beneath the cliff

    





there's an ocean between, when I see you (7s)

eyes as sharp as shining hooks
deeper oceans than wellsprings
of talking could ever be

so this hope is set onward
free into this prospective
sight whatever sea could be

    





The Rhythm Of The Southbound Train

Blow the whistle
Hear the rumble 
Rolling in your chest 

With tracks bound down
And feet locked east 
These carousels a crest

Around and round 
With heels of steel 
And steam so deep to mist
 
As a southbound train
He whistles now 
And his heart she travels west

    





The Right Choice Undoubted

All of the superficial, super-******, similarities in the world...
Are not worth an ounce of misunderstanding.
Or two ounces of lifelong regret.

    





The Right One

A beautiful notion isn't it?
Ironic even
The thought of waiting here like this
As if the act is somehow blessed with ease
When all around you is in motion
And you are as unstirring as the trees
Rooted deep within the mind
Looking at the other side
And seeing the blissful, beautiful ignorance
How often I wish it could be mine
That I had no such standards as this
And that I could swallow such a feeble line
Just like a fish
Nibbling on a willow wisp
In an ocean seemingly full of fish

Believe me…

I respect such idealism as this
Because I live with it
But to “just wait” and stay like this
At present holds little hope for me
Both to and from this someone else
There is no transfer, or passage of peace

Because these few years feel like an eternity

And so the term… 
“The right one?”
Makes want to say... 
“Oh please.”

    





The Right Way

Which way do you tip? 
When you dream of the kiss? 
Right, like me? 
Hopefully.

    





The Same

Though my hopes
My wishes
And my prayers 
May change

With each 
New season 
Of remind

My spirit 
And my smile 
Will always remain
Constant 
And the same

    





The Same Me?

I am too much of an all or nothing
Not enough of a contented now

An exhale warm in the breath of time
And a tall windmill standing still

With a quiet mind that won't shut up
And an open mouth to catch the rain

Unceremoniously I stand
On a world of ever encircling change

And I am the same
Am I the same?

    





The Same Night Sky

When I am here
I feel more near
Than two stars in the night sky

Right beside each other
Partners almost
And yet light-years away

Though not by choice
But perhaps design
As we could be, as we are in voice 

Ever trapped in this endless cycle 
Like the slow glowing impending 
Endless time

Like the space between most every breath
I'll be nearer to you after this goodnight
And yet no more than a distant star

For we are but two 
Of the many bright orbs 
Glowing in the grandest of sky's

    





These Are The Things

Space...
The only thing
Between these arms which ache.

Rain...
The only falling thing
In this loveless town.

Time...
Like every passing sight
Which was meant to be felt.

And pride...
For the only thing in your life
Worth tearing down.

These are the things always abound.

    





The Self Effect

If I knew, I'd know
And if I did, it would've already been - done

    





The Selfish Me Who You May Yet Know

When I read you
I’m most selfish and selfishly
Within my own inhabitants be
Close your eyes now you may see
That when I read your words aloud
(in this often times more than not)
I’m not reading you so much as
I am looking and listening 
There for me

    





The Separation Of Sun And Moon

Did you know?
That greatest couple 
Ever left for alive
Are estranged in the sky?
Barely glancing, never seeing
They're now just a hint
A reflection within the other's eyes

Although, back in their more youthful days
Oh boy, oh boy, were they alive
Burning with passion and cooling with shade 
Ever imprinting looks on each other's minds

But now only shade is ever thrown at the shine
Because the two original lovers are estranged in the sky
And ostracized to a life on high

    





These Seasons

As an old oak tree
Empties its arms in the fall of Autumn
So I must also empty my heart
In the springtime of this youthful you

    





These tall trees of light shine through glass department windows

This is a beautiful light which keeps
Itself alive for hours yet

By reaching out its beautiful hands
And arms within these windows clean

With tall and pensive shadows left
And glowing fortress right with ease

The last of this long important May
Outstretches its own spirits keen

And my eyes see
Be they only they 

This lover of sights says
My eyes see

    





The Shadow of the Mountain

Sitting on a mountain top
On a sliver of rock 
As jagged as the pointing edge of the west 
Indefinitely, is the earth beneath me 
For I do not know how long this will last 
But I know that I will sit and wait
For the sunrise of my youth to finally pass
Not because I fear the day that’s been or will be
But because I am smarter than the shadows 
Which will not outlast the light

    





The Sight

My hair, drifting in the howling wind
But you don't know the sight
To know that I am alive and well, within your eyes 
Though you don't know the sight

    





The Skies Which Inspire My Own

Skies like that 
Though coloring eyes for but only a day
Create new perspective in me
And remind me of my happiness 
For I am also colorful in that way

    





The Sky Which Watches Us Unfold

The greatest canvas 
Known as sky
Looks down on us
And sees the drama 
The ever-present 
Life of mortal 
Unfolding and 
Unwinding in 
It's skyborne 
Blueish eyes

    





The Social Truth

In this world of socialness and social media there can only be one God. And he does not share, comment, like or retweet.

    





THE SON

Pull the paper from the walls
   The color from the tiles beneath
Pull my mind from the strangers way
   And title me, not as one thing
But as first and foremost, THE SON of a king

    





The Sound of Lineage

Listen to the verbiage
The quietness of a different nature
The winds, the woods, the wildness
I am not my father
Though I am his son
I am me
And the past, the pretense
That's who he is

    





The Sound Of Rain

Like a thousand tiny pencil tips, 
Scratching out their little lines in eagerness. 

Like the rustling leaves of the many trees, 
Just beyond the meadow devoid of mist.

Like the tapping thimble of a seamstress, 
As she scatters a cup full of pins to *****.

So the rainfall here is near to me, 
With a sound I hold, above all else, most dear to me.

    





The Sound of Rain Kissed Leaves Which Fall

The rain unsettling shakes more than me
It shakes the summer out of the pensive trees
The quiet out of the evening still
The confidence out of the newfound skill
And more so than the colored leaves 
Which newly rest on dampened ground
As the sorting of the rain gives way
Resulting in a plethora of familiar sounds 
All merging beneath and moving fast 
Like a symphony of cicadas in the summers past 
Known only to one in time as the same  
As the parting whisper of the trees in rain

    





The Sound of Storms Approach

When you can hear the rain running through the trees
Scampering out from the great unknown
With a booming, thunderus, parental wave
The cosmos sounds
And the thunder calls it's children home

    





The Sounds Of Life On Earth

It's Virginia sun 
And Maryland rain
Southern thunder in the clever skies
The kind which makes the treetops shake
From Eagle Pass to outside Quebec 
Where is the earth if not in perfect place 

By mother nature's breath
I swear it's true

You were meant to be today
And these also with you

    





The Stars Were Never On Hiatus

All we see, when we look at the bright blue sky, is the effects of the sun
The results of her radiant all being purpose
You must look closer to find
That the stars were never on hiatus
In the first place

    





The Stillness of Goodbye

From the gentle curve of her subtle wrist
To the slenderness of her hand
Placed within 
My own already hers in mind 
It is there within the frozen moment
Which I am reminded of the absence 
The lack of time 
To communicate this distant feeling
And the stillness within this state of mind
For a centimeter is not even a half of an inch 
But an eternity
Which is no small distance 
To be separated from such a mind

    





The Stillness Within

I love this

The stillness of a cabin just before it's inhabitants, arise to make the coffee and consume the cakes

Like a breakfast mess of scrambled eggs, so I am mixed, and stirred by this, the stillness found within this place

Like a body of water, asleep at last

Or a wooded edge on a logging trail, finally left to be and pass

So I am also alive and well, inside of these hemlock boards 

And for but a moments time at peace

In a place where I can forget my more modern sensibilities 

And be taken back to a different time and a different place, where the woods still held their persuasive sway

A power over me

How they'd cast a spell upon my mind, most every time, when I was not as tall as these

Outside and near a different cabin, built by the hands of my father for free

But now, as I look out through the window, it's there I see

Out back, by a semi circle cleared of trees 

The stillness found in this good morning, in a different cabin, I am at ease

    





The Storms Approach One Summers Eve

I can hear
As it (comes)
With a distant approach
And a whisper which mingles
With treeward sounds

The rain (which gives)
Unabashedly as it pours 
It summer heart out
Over and down 
On us

It approach, quiet

    





The strongest winds are all within

Battled as a worrier be
I feel berated all around
Not just the wind or the waves
But by what I cannot see

As it is me always been 
Always will not hopefully
These constant battering thoughts 
Cautious tumultuous as is me

But if I'd speak as I speak
Lean on Gods listening
And just walk into freedom
Be it overtop of the sea

Next, I'm known longer lost 
But instead, free to be 
Like a sailboat again
Against winds constantly

    





The Sun And Moon Affair (a tanka)

Bright fire turns to ashe
Sunlight turns to dark of night
And night to mourning 
For it's loss of another 
Moonlit loverboys embrace

    





The Taste Of Salt

I've drained every wishing well</em>
Dried-up every puddle of water
And drank down every lake</em>, pond</em>, and looming ocean</em> 
Not a venue is left to quench my thirst
Or to quell the viscous expression in me
Which burns like the saline fires of the red sea</em> 
So I of course... Being of sound mind
Tilt my head back to the sky to catch the rain
For the sky provides the purity of mind 
To wash the taste of salt away 
And to remind me what it is like to drink 
Anew from the stream of each new day

    





The tenth haiku

There's no back and forth 
Left to be found here and when
All around are done

    





The Things Nobody Sees

There is no wear and tear
   Quite like the rebuilding of a man
      In the dark and quiet isolation of try
      Beneath it all
   These are the things nobody sees 
His skies

    





The Thin Line (Love And Hate)

Love turns to face Hate 
And at the altar says
"I am yours and you are mine "
Hate doesn't respond
Knowing similar sames 
And marital fate

    





The Three Year King

It's drive and focus 
   Edge and flexibility finesse 
It's youth which fades
   Bulls On Parade
   And my curse midst blessing
   One of many things
BEST my meaning, interesting
   As for one more year
   This old mortal
   Is king
Forward any doubters
   Doubts trying to bring

    





The Tides of Gifted Time, An Ocean

Just beyond the hillside windmills unstill
Where the horizon meets the sky
and eyes are lost in clouded light 
Brighter than all cares and graduation caps combined 

It is where the goodness of present day
And the tides of gifted times glide past
Beneath the feet of the lover stands
A happily shifting sand which has eroded away 

And the only thing left there between us to be
Is the sea
In all of its wonderous and most secretive 
Glory to be shared as one 

(And all this my dear, is just beyond)

    





The Timeless Winds And Whispering Trees

The breeze between my fingers holds me
Exactly where I need to be
Far
And for a moment found
Indefinitely 
Connected there
Almost lovingly with
The soundless trees
Which have whispered fair
Next to nothing's for all eternity

    





The Time Passage

The more aware you are of time
The more infuriating it's implicating becomes

Who would want immortality here?
In this halfway house
I do not know?

Yet he who keeps his calm doesn't know, but enjoys the most

    





The Tongue And Where It Tastes (It’s Good Today)

Meandering … I know right away
What the context of this dark entails
What the question of this day implies 
And so I'll answer 
In distilling this … in the stillness therein lies 
Though sunshine isn't yet necessary
To bring a shining smile to my face
Squinting on a day like this … born distinguishment 
When I know, I know
Like the *** and groundless coffee based
It is good today 
Gosh it's good today

    





The trees atop

The trees up here are thin and fair
Beneath thickened wind which howls away
How they bend and sway and cannot bare
To be spoken of as if they will not stay

I can feel the deep gray clay beneath 
The water where my father begs it lay
There is not so much as an autumn leaf of scented left
As there is searing cold to be brushed away

The trees up here are thin and fair
Beneath thickened wind which howls away
How they bend and sway and cannot bare
To be spoken of as if they will not stay

    





the true one, alone

Can anyone find me
A single mind of true solidarity 
Which sounds as good
As the nothingness of speech
Which I predict upon myself 

Both seamless and unendingly 

Until I am reminded that
I am alone again
And all too intimately 
Standing close and contentedly 
With no-one in particular 

Maybe my one is meant to remain?

    





The True Story Of A Storm Jumper

When a child hears a storm rolling
Or an old dog howls in the dead of night
And the thunder is crashing
The lightning is striking
And the heavy rain spouts outside are unfolding

That is when I
At the age fifteen
Would look to be out in the thunderous storm
Instead of inside beneath the crown molding 

Such storms were the reasons why I would be smiling
But also a reason why I would get scoldings

“You’ll get struck by lighting”
Said my mother to me
And then the voice of my sister would sound out with glee
Screaming “With Mom and Dad gone, you better not die on me!”

But I didn’t care
Because out there I was free
To jump high in the storm
And even flip dangerously
Because I was a storm jumper
Destined to be

    





The Truth

As a coin is lost deep in a well
   As a forest burns by a misplaced coal
      As every mountain ultimately degrades into shattered rock and falling stone
         So I'd rather be here now alone
            As compared to building a faulty and falling home

    





The Truth Above

Sometimes boys just want these eyes alive
And men, men want to write about women
And moon and stars and skies

    





The Truth Behind The Faceless Moon

The truth is that although I speak
I often don't know what to say
Let alone if I ever have an impact 
Like a crater on the faceless moon

Most nights my eyes are just too far away
To see the streaming rays of light
Which tumble down unto the earth
To illuminate the everglades where I am found

And though the truth is just ahead 
I cannot for the life of me pull it out 
Or turn the corner within myself

Because these words are not enough 
To represent my heart and mind
And how I feel alive and abound

Roaming round these hollow hills
Excited to hear your latest thought
Least that is the truth as I see it now
As the faceless moon kindly smiles down

Onto the wooded world in mind
How I breathe a sigh when I am found

    





The Turnings Of The Ever Earth

Nothing demotivates the soul
Like safety 
Keeping you from the wind beneath your feet
The wings beneath your shoulders felt
Just as weeds, the weeds, grow ever still
In their moving way they never break
And our human plot of life is to take 
Our hands to the earth in constant misery 
Knowing that all things will grow
Both around us and through 
All things inevitably will come due

And the earth will continue on, probably long after me
Spinning

    





The Twelve Loves

We love the rain
We love the night
We love the heart
We love the sea

We love the snow
We love the sun
We love the quiet
We love the trees

We love the dawn
We love the song
We love the sands
We love the birds

We love the warmth 
We love the cold
We love the girl
We love the earth

How we love and love
And for a short while, our world

    





The Twenty Seventh Thought

My life is not free
It is
breath to be breathed
blood to be shed
.      on behalf of
.      me

    





The Twilight Mr. Jones

Ashen daggers stick
Digging at secrets
Prompter of every questioning man
Who already knows where death's shoes stand

Just behind the curtain
In the plain sight of night revealed
And the sun
The sun expects him not the be a blight 
On the daylight strolling hills

So instead of hitching with the strange 
And innocent alley cats and saints 
Like a stray dog bound with one bright eye
Darkness rides like dust on the rails
Of Mr. Jones and his coattails 

Thus the law which ought to be instilled 
Forevermore held in place is this
No time for him should ever waste
As attacks imagined, grant to him
Such a silent advantage which he'll always take

Do you
Still bring all living things 
To still?
Mr. Jones?

    





The Uninstall

I reject you

Oh modern soulless 

Hallow chest of a shell

Plundered socially left

And more negatively right

The swipe I say

Is a curse at best

On the men of this

No longer protruding 

Less West

    





The Unwritten

A man
Falls always from his pen again
And rolls a thought into a distant hand 

As stories 
Ever meant to pass 
Are passed by 
With the hope of hopes

That in someone else's world
His words will last

    





The Valley

When surrounded by darkness of every kind 
As the fog of sadness hangs it head 
To wallow low, in the valley below 

Only you can smile, be it there beside
Only you can be gracious and ever kind
Within that moment

May you be so,</em> for those who you know will not be so</em>
For the retaliation is not to react
But only to only act out of what is kind

That way your own head won’t hang low 
As you pass through this 
The valley of perpetual time

    





The vaulter

His standards 
No pole vaulter on acid could touch
So high

    





The Visible Man

I am not lost
Just kicking dust 

I am not of starlight 
But I burn 

And though I'm totally 
Something worthy nothing

And growing most daily 
Beneath the eyes of seeing 

It's in the looking 
And finding next to breathing

That of me 
You will ultimately learn

    





The Wait

No matter how much I change
Remain the same
See myself or lose sight
Try and fail
Fly by the seat of my words
Or not cry

No matter where I am
Or how much time I spend
In the vastness of mind 
Or quietness of sleep

No noise contends
New sound remains
Or feeling fails to fall from the night sky

No matter who, or alone, or with, or why
Regardless of meaning or resolving on time

No indescribable thing reveals itself
When I'm ready, when I'm waiting, when I'm wanting to find

    





The Way Light Means More

It can pierce a veil of darkness
Unravel like the extension of an arm
And seep, deep into folds of the extreme
Coloring the simple walls of where we've already been
And in your eyes I can see it still
Like the warming sentiments of summer
As the winter ground reflects it all around
Because inside is where the light bends
And without break it begins a sound

    





The Willow Whips

It bends its back and cracks its spine
Out of sheer frustration 
Much like a whip 
For as it is, it seems to be, and ever will be
The unchangeable, and the uncommented 

Much like the silent birds which breathe, yet are not without their own beauty
How they never sing, and will never speak of such things
Because this is how, and this is when 
I know why the willow whips do weep

For as we are one and from the same 
How they cry in silence, not out of vanity, but out of frustration
Because you, in stay, know no other way 
Than to pass them by before they can speak

Of the way your footprints tread on the teeming dandelions
Leaving only the meadow left in pain 
For you are so invested in your own sunshine 
That you neglect to see and hear the same
That the willow whips now weep in pain

    





The Wind Behind All Rustling Leaves

About the wind
From here where I am wondering
In
How it endlessly whips through the hair of the willow lace
Calms the desperate sigh of the wandering mind
As its own embrace 
Reaches across every state and barrier
Being felt by many whose hand will never hold  
Yet wonder about the leaf born trees
From rock and acorn, stem and root
I don’t wonder about their noise or leaves
For the wind is behind it all
I see
Just as you are motionless
Silent to me

    





The Woods Belong To Memories

It seems that I am destined 
To love the sound of such leaves 
Rustling in the Autumnal memory
Even when another once wished to climb
The very height of my own trees

I am haunted and haunting
Though unconsciously done

    





The Words of Others (No)

I refuse to reuse to the point of self abuse 
To run from the fear of knowing
Into the arms of those I've already known

No</em> 

I will create it on my own
Not out of pride for my own success
(of which I will see little)

No</em>

But because in order for it to exist 
I must first find, create and remember this
That, noone besides me
Can ever be me

And that noone will know
If I always say *No

    





The Writers Bench

If they would dedicate a bench to me, I'd have them lay some fresh concrete, not much, just about four feet. 

I'd have them place a pad and rusted seat, between the adult framing trees and paint it green. 

And henceforth, it would be known as the writers bench, dedicated to all of the sights left unseen, from that particular spot to be. 

But I doubt they'd waste a bench on me.

And perhaps, that spot's better left to the grass and trees. 

To the living me.

A quiet, well framed, subtle spot where a man can breathe.

    





the written carolinas

if we all dream of her, and her sister too, thus
do the Carolinas ever return the favor
and dream of us
?

    





They're Just Words, Right?

They aren't just standing there 
Breathing in and out your air

They are standing at the very spot
Seeing with the same clear eyes

And feeling that which you once did
The breath, the silence, the reply

    





The Zora Symphony

Symphonic fountain 
Work your way
Carve out the hearing, sound a stream
And flow within 
Trickling, never dropping or dripping
But moving steadily towards the heart
To meet the rising steam
As lillypads mourning
Are pulled by the stem into a watery sea
Let this gentle sound pull me beneath
The surface tense 
Until all my former fear are broken
And I am but a rippling sound
Another trickle towards uniformity

    





This drive begins again

I am that which is becoming

The realization of my dream

Which I’ve been asleep to for these past ten years

And ten years from now I’ll wake again

And in a new direction turn suddenly

Unendingly

And into the sun

    





This Moment In Time

My ears are open 
My eyes are to the sky 
God I will try
But help me let this go 
If I must

    





This Someday Heart and Soul

Somedays I just want to sit
At a coffee shop and think
About all of the thoughts I’ve yet to see
All the skies I’ve yet to be

    





This Way? Or That?

What can I say
When things are this way?
Not much I’m afraid 
Make a comparison to the difference, be it night or day…
<strong>Cheesy</strong> 
</em>Tell you that it will not always be this way…
<strong>Untrue</strong> 
</em>Because only we as a race can say 
And determine what it means 
To be loved and to love
At least in this, this certain way 
So what can I say?
When things are this way
Just be wise and be true 
When you question that way

    





This Yearning Be

I love you more than anything me.
Wait for you like ocean tides knowing.
And speak with fire bright stars, 
   where our hearts reside, burning.
In ever we will be togehter in
   this yearning.

    





Those Outside

These people
 Their dreams
 Their metaphors 
 Their ideas
 Their ideals
All of them 
  They 
  Theirs
  These
All of those
   Of which are there
All of them
   To those who be
Are all for them
But not for me
Not for me

    





Thought, Belief, and Falling

Thinking isn't believing 
Just as jumping isn't wings revealing
And stars falling is just burning
Unlike the belief of atmosphere 
Which prefaces thoughts and is forever turning

    





Though The Seas Catch Fire

Where the sea meets the horizons shine 
Inquisitive your eyes 
Where your hairline meets your eyebrows raised 
There also are mine and my praise  

(4LINE)

    





Thought Selfish

Are thoughts all the happier
When they think they're thought?
Or tucked away in a book pressed flat
And stored away for another day?
I think not
At least speaking for myself and for my own thoughts
They are quite demanding, unfolding
And unwilling to thought of as naught

    





Thoughts midst dreams

Fear is such a fleeting thing
A dream a dream
And in waking seeing 
How's its gone as if it were never in being

But thoughts such as these
Which plague seven times over me
Are so much harder to set free
So much more difficult to let be

I am haunted by possibilities

    





Thoughts most uncommunicated

We think about that 
Which we want the most
But daren't try for
Lest someone else know
That we are capable 
Of such hope

    





Threading Media

I fear no pixel
Images are water and air to breathe 
And meet 
At the hands of a needled creator
Seamless are these

    





Threads of memory and mind

No subway car will ever hold my thoughts
No taxi will ever call me solved

Instead, I wait
Always create 
And let not my being affect what will be

Like the string, I unwind
And pull these lost memories out of me

One at a time
So that the world can see

    





Three Of Five

A wish is no more want or desire. A blink in the eyes of the eternal mind. Our love but a memory in an ocean of sighs. I hope not an ounce of salt within to find.

    





Threnodic Voice

Inches away from you
        Never there but ever present 
        As your breath is lifted up unto the heavens 

Elevated is the air upon your words 
        Escalated, the anticipation of your voice 
        Among the noise 

Where the only scene to see is peace 
        Held quietly in reverie
        And respect for your mere presence 

Find with ease 
        The smile of the self-reveals
        A quietness of hearts appeal 

Not to be seen 
        But to seek the conversation speak 
        And to peak the words of interesting 

Mere inches now away from me 
        With no voice let to find the time 
        Or threnodic melody 
       
Don’t let me down
        My inward voice
        Speak

    





Through A Window

All along 
I’ve been looking through
The stained, the pure
The meaning of clear

With a surreal light 
Which bends the prism
And frees me from physical
Prison cell

And all along I’ve been looking through
The edge of iron and steel
The wood, the window
The highest ideal

    





Through Leaves

You are my view through youthful trees
A glimpse through out of focus leaves
Slightly akilter yet without runoff
You make me want to paint anew
With paint for you
As if I had once been sought

    





Through The Long And The Lonely Nights

After all of the summers spent alone
The turning autumns approach 
And the attempts at running through walls 
(which would not give way)

It's by lakeside fires which glow and grow
In crackling sparks lifted up

And in finding no more found
This diminishing day, once ends 

For no matter how hard I try
Or wish or pray 
It's always you who I don't find
As I just can't seem to make you mine

    





Through Windows Past, New Dawn Awaits

No youthful regrets beset 
None of that stuff shines to last
I do not, will not
Look back through closed windows without seats of cushioned green, no
A neck is facing forward for a personal fast 
And I for the hunger next of dawn
Will taste all that the future holds
Nothing 
Will turn 
Me back

    





Tide Pools

Deep, somber, reflective pools. 
Stirring by an ocean of blueish gray. 
Vast as the mountain and all of its roots,
Clear and deceptive as the piercing light on a cloudy day. 

Not flustered by the coming storm, 
But troubled instead when it is blown off its course and swept away. 
Unshaken by the torrential downpour of warming rain. 
For cool inside they will ever stay. 

Such pools as these are ripples away from some escape. 
Yet when all other pools would've walked away,
They stir themselves and still remain. 
Fixed and introspective. 

Much like the tides which arrive anew with each coming day. 
These waters rise and though they reach, 
The wonder and bewilderment is never washed away.
From within such pools.

    





Timber Adrift

I wander alongside aimlessly 
Floating down a path like a half of chaff 
Wondering what it means to be 
As tall as the ivory hickories 
To be as weightless as the leaves  
Or lost within the present pause 
Where I am more often than not
Considered to be me
 
As I stop myself and start again
In wonderment of what I find
Alone in this and thought amiss  
I disconnect myself from the moderneness 
And find myself here standing out 
Tall and alone amongst the trees 
In place where I need not create 
The peace of mind which I do seek

    





Time

Time is a river
A perspective
A current washing through your fingers

    





Time After Time

Tell myself
To reinvent myself
To create a location to do it in
Only to leave it free and standing be 
Again and again

Too slowly I find myself abound
To go out into this rainy world
To hear the sky and the people aloud
With clouded eyes
While that place remains empty and then

It's always away from the aimless creation of space
In which I begin
And begin again

    





Time, A Tanka Told When

Wish it well and back
Into the past pockets of
Those who knew and know
Of telling and told alike
Of mind there is no failure

    





Time Concurred All

The greatest of kings,
Who concurs all earthly things
Is time, inhuman

    





Time itself is a hungry beast

Time is not a question or thought
A perspective or construct or worry or hope 
Time is a different animal entirely 
Who will devour your off day 
Just as quickly as he would consume a summers day whole

What a monster indeed, appears time to me
Terrifyingly normal, he grows old
But never fat

    





Time, It won't

I trick myself
More often than most
That the time before me will feel better 
(somehow)
Than the air which I now breathe most close

It won't 

Time is time 
Just as a perception is a vision of the mortal mind
Most unknown 
Heck, I 
Need to learn how to live for the moment of most

It's time

    





Time Lies (more and more)

Time says
"Love me and I will love you back, want me more and more"
And I, find less and less of those things within time to adore

    





Time Passes

The lack of the eternal
  Within my own eternity 
    Has never bothered me 
      Before this
        Before today 
          I cannot am
            I cannot want
              I will not be

    





Time's Lie

No second ever existed 
Without a human mind first
Trying to tie at knots and count creation

    





Time Unbroken, A Tanka

Time before you know
It's working ways undone slow
And in fastness fly
That life was spent waking up
In dreams of doing we die

    





Timing

Your time
My time
Never Ours
But I have to believe above all else
In God and his timing
Which does not faulter
Which knows no human bounds
In this I trust
And nothing else

    





Tiny Torches

Desperately
Wishing only to feel I will seek
For the sake of being able to keep 
My feelings alive and at peace
Like an undisturbed meadow I sleep

In the presence of shimmering lights
That have risen from flowers to be
Tiny torches which light up the night so that my eyes could see

Be it only the shadowing trees
Or the neighboring meadows at ease
My eyelids will wither and seep
To the base of my hollowing cheeks

In my ears are the rustling leaves
Singing softly of lingering peace
So like the last autumn breeze
Would you blow through my life
Bring me peace

Wake me up to the sound of the trees
Hear the hum of your heart as it beats
In a pattern known only to me
In my mind you were always with me

Standing by hoping that we could be
In the moonlight in which we could see
The bright stars in the sky and the fires of the far galaxies

Dry your eyes on the willows which weep
Hear my voice in the summery breeze
For it’s here you will find every remnant of me
Every word which I wrote on the leaves

And perhaps in due time you will see
Tiny torches afire like me
How they fade and ignite every night 
Though my light never burned aimlessly

    





to be True

Don’t cast your belief upon other people
  or think yourself too dreamy or not 
no lasting deal is ever left on the table 
  no potential memory is wrought with forgot 

Cast stars like lines and looks like dice 
  and roll and roll yourself ever on 
say yes to the self which you’ve yet to be
  speak truth to the could of want and beyond

    





To color a tanka shadowy gray

Color grows above
And wrestles darkness down slow
Behind the mountains
Peaking into wondrous lost
The next day is found awake

    





To Create Is To Be Free

When a mans intent becomes one with his craft
He is not the same man so much anymore 
Because the actions of a man midst passion is more 
Than whatever his mindset had since set before
And his intent all along though it long since has passed 
Is still willed into present
When he's one with his craft.

    





together we shake

laying down atop your hope
a shake doesn't determine intimacy alone
but an earthquake certainly is a certain reassurance 
of such destructive people as we were when there together 

listening . to . the earth

    





Tolkienology

Old stories have ever burned 
Even in the deepest, darkest, winters of my heart 
As they are renewed with every new year 
And rewritten in the memory of every new spring

    





To Me

Press the sound into your ears
Until the commotion is but a whisper
And then look at me so you might see
Exactly what this song mean

    





To me, Be

It's nothing 
p·e·r·s·o·n al

It's everything
person a·l·i·t·y

    





Tom's Lament

My Goldberry

My heart runs dark as blue berries
For you and for your inevitable change

With soft and growing orange light
With cool water wandering skies
You are all of me and as much mine

My Goldberry
Would you never stop
And always change though you needn't try

I give to you my conscious though
And you give to me
Your mercurial eyes

The way of seasons past like our memories passing by

    





Tone is Tone

If my name was more unique
   My cadence more strong
   My words more angry
   Or my roving eye of justice 
   — More outstretched and long
Maybe then I would stand out to you
Maybe then I would start to sing anew
But probably not
As you cannot sing what is not meant to be your song

    





Too Long, Too Late

It's been too long** since I had sap on my fingertips, beneath my nails 

<strong>It's been too long</strong> since I've passed by the turkey blind which I built for myself, almost a lifetime ago 

<strong>It's been too long</strong> to know exactly how a clearing fades but never grows 

But <strong>it's never been too late</strong> to walk there again, to ***** my feet in the spring of Earth, and to speak out loud in the cool breeze until I can no longer feel my nose

No, <strong>it's never been too long,</strong> or <strong>too late,</strong> for walks like those

    





Too Personal To Read

I do not know
What I mean to you
If anything
But I would like to know
I would like to know

    





Torn Heart In Hand

When I realized
That I was left to stand
There heart in hand 
Tearing myself apart just to give me to you
And it wasn’t that you didn’t want me
It’s that you never truly knew

    





To See

Don't think that I'm being brave just for me 

Well perhaps initially, it was so

But to see the kind of person I will 

And most definitely would like to be 

Be it down the road

That will take time in order to see

    





To Send Her Coffee For Christmas

Knowing a name
A face
A distant friend
Isn't enough to say 
That you can
Because you cannot
Until
Do so much 
As pretend
Because you have not
Yet since
Been invited in

    





To Swim Is To Live

Learn from this undread
Come wave or crashing waters down
We all get wet in the sooner or later
Don't fear
Only a few ever drown

    





To Think

Run from being 
Into un
And find yourself
In nothingness for a time

Don't worry
The clocks always come around
Just like payments due
So are you to bound

    





Tousled Hair

Radiance is not
Merely the sand or sea breeze
But you there at ease

    





Towards The Sky

Reach into the nothingness
Like a warm breath slipping into the cold night
Hands outward, eyes open, upwards towards the sky

Embrace the silent subtle voice
Which hides behind the daily routines
But is no less mindfully alive

Cast images onto the fog itself
Until you've seen the many dreams which you've procured for yourself
In this cloudy life

Breathe with the forgetfulness of evey waking step  
As you amble through these miles set
With jawline firm and eyeline slight

Smile at the passing sight of another universe in tow
Which ambles by and out of view
As your inward story comes alive

And live not in line with every Crow on any high wire
But fly as if there were no tomorrow in your quiet sigh
Upwards and towards the sky

    





Towards the sunset

All the sunsets I regret
Are not for a lack of looking on
But for a lack of moving into them
As I ought

    





Towards The Surface

I am a bubble fluctuating
On its way to the surface, evaluating
How it will be to be one with sky again, once I am out of the sea
I’ll be bursting free and culminating into a timeless cloud
Into the air which was always meant to be me
Yes, towards the surface I go to be free

    





Towers

The greatest secret
Allowed to survive in this place
Is that this place is hers
And that I am here
Next to her own

    





To Whisper (a tanka)

This is the wind born
As it wimpers through the trees
A willful whisper
Midst the meadow mindfulness
Willing it will ever be

    





Treeful

Somedays
A cold existence as a tree

Calls out to me
This warming flesh
So full of fault and failure anew
So weak in ages duress 
And yet
The trees they see with neutrality and
Fall freely each year in the form of leave
They live, they die, they oversee
And grow taller than I could ever hope to be
One ring can not compare
To the many found therein with these

Somedays
I envy the trees

    





Tree Leaves

The leaves are dying
Drifting down like falling snow 
To see the veins which grow thin and pale
To hear their weathered limbs of grey cold 
And when his bark and bite is no longer feared 
And when her comfortable canvas is stripped away 
No branch to catch a falling hand 
No root to stretch nor wrap and rest
Too many names already carved 
With no new branches left to trim
The colors once which changed with age 
Now stay the same till clearer days 
Perhaps the spring will no more grow
Perhaps this ends a present-day 
But the leaves are dying ever still
And what's more concerning is
How they know, it is their way

    





Trickery

The greatest feat
An idealist can conceive

Is to create existence out of nothing
To create someone out of no one

And make it up so real
That everyone accepts that it is

And desires themselves to believe 
That it always was

    





Trixy

The greatest trick that the devil ever played. 

Was not in death or in speech to exist. 

But in convincing manking that it was God who'd been made.

    





Trsuted Haiku

Kindness knows no end
Until the trust is destroyed
And remains no will

    





True Beauty

She is everything I wish to be mine
I can attest to the aptitude of her body
Like the wave of her hair as she passes by
But I've yet to confirm the hope within
That being her true lovelliness of mind

    





True Fear (of Mismatched Minds)

I'm not afraid of birds and beasts
Of men, of death, of passing time
Not often at least
How I catch myself
Although such fears can certainly be
Very valid in the viewer’s mind

No, I am afraid of something else, of something like this:
<strong>"What will I find when I get to that place, to the end of that line?"</strong>

And therein within, at the end of all things
When there is no tape left for me to rewind

I find my fear which is in fact, that I'll be left
Trying to understand and satisfy both of our minds

How actively and willing I’ll always be to compromise
But, that one day, I'd become this way 
Like the only one who prays each day
To walk the narrow, bitter line

For years and years
That way to be
Simply stuck to you, and stuck with me

Trying to bend and break most faithfully
Until I meet my own demise and internalize the eternity

That, is the fear, which frightens me

Because a wise man says not change their ways
But change your own, first in your time

Which I can do because I’m me
But just being a wise man doesn't means
That I'm not a human
And that I won't desire change equally

For such a fear is real to me
Because I've witnessed, time and time again
The bitterness of inequality

    





True Genius

Truly exceptional people who do truly exceptional things, had the option to be ordinary every day. They just chose to pursue what they could never explain, but will always dream.

    





True Growth

A strong person 
Although possibly repetitious
Is never the same
As the person they were 
Before they became 
Their current self
Because strength is change 
And change is strength
In the arms of regular growth and application

    





True In Truth

The greatest sign
Of a most conscious might

Is not to devour and to destroy
All of the falsehoods of life

No

But a true clue is
To let them exist 
So that the true sees truth 

And yes
In this

    





True Leadership

A true leader</em> is a selfless soul, 
One who thinks not for himself, 
But for the others, for the many
For the halves and for the whole, of humanity

Regardless of age or importance to man, 
It’s not in the memory of their great names, 
In with which we stand. 
But in the willingness to mold
One’s self into a servant, 

To humbly hold the troubled hand, 
And to become the kind of person who doesn’t abuse,
The right to demand
 
But instead, looks to enable others, 
So that they might just begin, and begin again
 
Because all of the power in the world,
Can be abused, and removed if misused

For this, my dear leaders,</em> I ask of you, 
To not lose yourself in the arrogance
Of discovering that you are indeed you 

Because true leadership</em> is not about you
And leadership</em>, will never be about you
So before you lead, would you let go of you
That way you might win in spite of you

    





True Life

Occasionally, you may be impressed 
Because someone else came close
Someone else seemingly understands what you hold most dear
Be it inside or out
But the mistake is to assume that because they seem
They are the same
When really, true life is all about graciousness and kindness
A willingness to mold and be molded
That way you will become, as they are also becoming

    





True Nature

When a young man grows 
And thinks not of of himself
He will find instead
Much thought
Of the framework which he can provide 
The direction in which he will strive
And of the quality of those to reside alongside

    





True Symmetry Of Mind

We are not fragile 
You and I 
Nor are we blunt and filled with either dramatic or traumatic cries
No talk of sea or stars or moon or sky 
Can compare to the mirror and its vacant airs
To the coin and its other side alike 
Of the same material made within different minds
No other two halves can compare
Or be undone as one
With so much as a stare it is know to be
No?
Our love is a spiral
Be it up or down 
Ever perfectly in earth or air

    





True To You

Looking for validation and affirmation in the entirely wrong places, will always leave you feeling unsuccessful and totally decimated.

Crushed and devalued by the plans you didn't make, as your focus is derailed by the paths you didn't take.

Because you cannot progress without true motivation to improve your daily situation. 

For this you must act on evaluation and ignore the masses of any nation, which insists that you can do anything, within certain limitations.

Who are they to know you and why you even exist within creation? 

Just do as you feel called to do and you might just find your inspiration.

Only then will you have a chance at redeeming and receiving the aforementioned words of affirmation. 

Because you need to be true to you, to find your truest motivation.

    





True Words

The discovery of true words
Is but one of the many mysteries we seek 
Both under stones and under moon
And in the volumes of our histories, we find
That no two words were ever successfully left alone
No sentence of the mind was ever so perfect as to be 
The word of God without inspiration 
No, mere mortal words I find to be
The loneliest of lonely things
But true words are of a great ideal 
And ideals are often shrouded in such mysteries 
And THIS … Is where you may laugh at me

(:

    





Trusting In The Stars (through hard times)

Though storms relief 
Be in no sky near where you may be
Remeber and in seeing me
Breathe 
Like the stars will always be enfused with fire
A breath like we will always ignite

    





Truth

It's not that I hate people

I don't 

It's that I hate those expectations of myself 

Which I place upon myself

When such people are near

    





Truth And Humor

Sarcasm is the cowards wall

Hide behind the most obvious observation
But deny the subtle truth you believe
And walk the same way

But know this, so
By the sound of your footprints, I will know
What you really think, what you really believe 

Your prejudice shows

    





Truth Is...

Not to be found 
But reaffirmed in mind
As no verse will ever lift you up
Or bear your cross quite like
Christ

    





Tundra

The bitter road
With walking feet and identical pace

     Fear not 

For they are all just shadows underneath
Just ghosts beneath the turquoise ice 

     Quiet as can be

And you will not fall
You will not falter

As you have colder blood within your veins 
Than in every surreal arctic peace

    





Turning

On a dime it turns 
Vertical and sharper than any knife 
Falling to one side
Suddenly 
And the next thing you know
You’re not there anymore
In life

    





Twelve Words, One Question

What countenance could keep
my fascinated feet 
from following ⁠—
wherever you've been?

    





Two, Alone With Song

When you can see the vibrations
On the sanguine strings

When you can soak the sounds
And rinse it from the unsaturated air

When the quiet head fold softly 
Falling atop the masters knees without a conscious care

That is when
And their matters not, where

    





Two, A Single Man's Haiku

Waiting for you two
To pass as me by a one
Only then we'll find

    





Two eyes and two

Mine are not two eyes of gold
As an ouce of blue more can be found
Don't ask as to where they look around
Every second, of every day, instead
Like a passing light, step inbetween 
Ever flashing still, look back at me
In unstumbling step instead stand before
No one else will ever see
Except for thee

    





Two Kinds of People

There are certain people who are going places
Who are doing things even when they are standing still
Such people posses a tremendous will
To succeed and grow, to change and know 
And then there are others, who are just standing still

    





Two Lovers, East and West (4LINE)

Closing eyes to remain alive 
No breath remains intact 
With open mind over Pacific ends
No Atlantic hope will last

    





Two Of Five

Some days I ache like the desert for rain. And others for the end, of Tsuyu one and the same.

    





Two Seasons

Rainfall is not Fall
Just as snow does not Spring forth
But returns to Fall

    





Two sets of steps

Jazz I love
perfect sidewalks, like
but you are the epitome of life
in a daily stride walking there beside

I could 
certainly

    





Umm, your girl...

If shes loves the ocean and late nights. Is constantly coming out of her shell. And if, her voice has been, described as the bows of violins. She is down with all the omega-3 fatty acids, then.

That's not your girl, that's a lobster

    





Umm Yup

In nether regions
Downward last
In valleys carved 
And chartreuse hopes 
I wish to be 
There in you

    





Unactualize Desire

My desire for you
More than anything 
Is that you'd be at peace beneath these eaves
That you could sleep more deeply than the sea
And dream, oh baby that you could dream
Of the distant starlight you can barely see
My desire for you
More than anything
Is that you'd be my most comfortable everything

    





Unbound

A shoestring I am
Like a railroad tie without a shirt
Or a pair of cufflinks without caboose
Unbound
Unbridled
Unshackled 
Alive
Like a stallion without pen or care
I write without knowing what it means
To ride

    





Understanding

How foolish of me to think that I could understand
That I could even possibly comprehend whatever it is or whoever it was
Because clearly the struggle that I did undertake was something that I could not withstand
But even so and as I am
I cannot understand
Because I am just a mortal
I am just a man
But I wish I could
I wish you can

    





Under The Illuminance

The same sky smiles down on us
Happy to see the same
Or similar these dreamy thoughts
Your milky eyes 
But are you looking back at these
Or at someone else? 
At the moon or the song which reverberates and comes back to you
For yellow is in your veins

    





Under Thinking

Time to be, 
Not even yourself. 
In the memories of another. 
Doing so helps.

    





Un·ending·light

Though my eyes may turn
And in darkness
Try to hide

It is beneath this earthly chest
In which where, light 
Will always reside

Un·ending·ly

    





UNI

College is
A peaceful mind
Because it's years
And years
Of nonthinking 
Thought

Free of judgement
And greatly
At a price
Often bought

    





Uniqueness

Calling you
You
Calling me
Me
Is like saying your smile is unique because of teeth

    





Unknown, A Tanka

Time knows not it's own
Ticks and subtle sounding clicks
Which pass by like days
In the minds of men who know
That life as is exisits 

(Time's Arrow)

    





Unmagination, a Triad Poem

Why is it so hard for me? 
To imagine what I can be 
To hope upon another day 
But also stumbling pointlessly 
My soul dissipating like wisps of smoke 
Enchanted clouds alive elope 
Maybe is this something of a joke



(Written by two friends and myself, just one line at a time)

    





Unnatural Cold

Ever since the sky first spoke 
And warned me of this new treacherous you

I cannot unsee or unfeel the feeling
That these trees here have become too small
And been too old all along

For the youthful being still growing in me
I must repair to another day 
When such a sounding mind was but s song

And now I know that I'm too warm a day
For such a cold unbegotten breeze of you

    





Unrest

It's not there untill it is proven
            I create the <strong>unrest</strong> inside

    





Unrest All Around

Neither the quiet comforts of your home
Nor the wonders of the great unknown
Will satisfy your thirst to know
The wandering rest within your bones

In one way or another 
How the shoe turns and Crow flies
Untill no longer bound
Homeward
We are all alone

    





Unscripted Fate

Create for yourself
The life you most want
And live it out now
Before it's too late

Admit what is true
About yourself 
And embrace it now 
So that you can escape 

Into goodness of this 
Your future at present
Would you breathe it in now?
Your unscripted fate

    





Unseen Beauty

Would you turn your head ever so slightly?
Just for a moment so that I could see 
Your face hidden beneath your hairs embrace

Because if ever there were a chance to be
I would sit beside you for eternity
And watch the autumn leaves turn back to green

And at dusk if you were to fall asleep
I would shoulder your head with my own cheek 
And hold you there until the sunrise peaked

But only if you'd turn your cheek 
Just this once so that I could see
The place where my lips wish to be

How they desire to meet with your unseen beauty

    





Unspoken Questions

Would you hide with me, unwind with me? 
Would you sew my home for an hour or so? 
Would you let me cook for you into the night unknown?

Would you listen to me, would you speak the words? 
Would you fall back into the quiet, until, we can hear the obnoxious chirping birds?

Would you want my hand as I want your mind? 
Would it matter if I asked you for just a little more time?

And your body, your spine, in its perfect align. 
Is but a hopeful wish for distant tomorrow. 
One that belongs to the keeper of heart in due time.

But then, in such situations as this, to ask...
Would my courage not fail me?
Would such moments now last?

    





UnStill

The best way to get over yourself 
Is to start climbing
To stop thinking
And to start seeing yourself as
Something truly surmountable

    





Unwind

Though weary eyes are still worth seeing,
Sometimes the sight isn't worth the time.

I'd encourage you instead to rest, 
And escape from yourself within your mind.

Just go close your eyes and be at peace,
Embrace the darkness with remind. 

Like a weary ball of worn out string, 
Sleep quietly until you unwind.

    





Unwinding

If work, a sea, has tossed me asunder 
Then I in two, will sit on the edge of a caffeinated cliff 
And write about it, about me, about you

    





Unwinding Now, Out

Tampering like a kitten string
   Like a ball of yarn, I am, unwound
And in sinking now
   Into a bath of bygone grace 
Of comings, and goings, and beings, and nothings 
   As of made last night, late decisions by candles, unsound
Here in my weakness, drying, stretching out 
   My tired mind unveiled to you 
Go ahead with enjoyment
   My indulgence, go ahead
And have fun with me now

    





Up At Her

All she ever wanted
Was for me to never stop 
Looking up
Into those beautiful eyes with white outlines

And it's with a sigh I say
That no but</em> or excuse</em> can justify 
My faith or lack thereof 

And now all I can say is that I
Henceforth will aspire higher 
Open my eyes wider
And look upwards as I try
And ever longingly reach her sky

Up At Her
Up At Her
In her blue my own eyes come alive

    





Upwards, in the distance

Mountains are not mountains 
IF
You neither climb 
Nor longingly look
Towards
Their present absence

    





U.S P.S

If I could box up all of the words
The most beautiful ones that I've found
And send them to you in the mail 
I would do it without hesitance
Because beautiful words don't belong in my world 
And I'd much rather see them alive and well 
In the hands of a fluid reflective girl 
Who might just meld them into song
In a world where such words actually belong

    





Valley

In the crook, in the valley
Find me lost within your bliss
With contented countenance 
And satisfactory feeling of infinite rest 
Found on me
Find me none the less impressed 
Regardless of height or extent
For I am lost in bliss and blissfulness 
In you

    





Vance

You walk in
and the world walks away
from whatever it was doing
for just a fragment of that day

There is no forward, no back, no other way
for this spherical, circular, world bent on its way
to keep on spinning any longer

In your orbit it stops 
and absorbs your wandering radiance 
as a warming sponge 

For a moment at least
the greatest light of this universe concedes
and your radiance rivals the sun

Vance

    





Venting, A Haiku

Who can master tongue
No friend without friend to hear
Can find self silent

    





Vibrance, A Tanka

When I think back now
To a time when time was not
Of such vibrant thought 
And I feel the weight of be
In this world of being now 

(Where I Am More Aware, Now)

    





Virtue And Wisdom

All earthly holes
Can be dug around and out
But virtue and wisdom
Hard earned and fought for 
Such value cannot be understated
In terms of being found

    





Vitality

TRY ME<strong>
Like swimming in the sea
I am a wave crashing over you
With a current too strong
And too deep

</strong>TRY ME<strong>
On the side of a cliff
With arms outstretched and fingers clenched
Reaching for everything
Be it far short of eternity

</strong>TRY ME<strong>
When I’m standing tall
Like a pendulum
Rocking in the springtime of youth
Until my stride becomes a bitter fall

</strong>TRY ME<strong>
As the wicked winds are howling
Having carved their way inland
Ever trying to push me off the edge
Midway through my own decent 

</strong>TRY ME<strong>
If you dare

</strong>TRY ME<strong>
If you will

</strong>AND TRY ME<strong>
If you'd like to see

All of the *TRY</em></strong> that is left in *</em>ME

    





Vitriol

Vitriol
Spit it out
And keep a more civil tongue in your head
A more round noun in your mouth

    





Vivamus ac procursu

No heights can test
This smokey breath 
Breathe out another jog and let 

This heartbeat ache
Which throbs in pace
And patters like the dove and yet 

To feel your feet
Guide underneath 
Like oceans smooth with opal flow 

Its warming breath 
And pounding chest
This besting high you runners love

    





Voice

Soft is the wind ere the trees 
And rough is my voice running through each
As are flowers in the month of June, so beautiful
And yet cursed by the coming fall
As after which, above the earth, all else will fall
Until the clouds and morning dew have meld in, above the heath
Ungrown as I am in the mind of you
But it would not be so, if you would see me through

    





Voiceless

My words most dry
Call nothing 
And certainly not out 
Or about
To me

    





Wait fearlessly

Waiting for you to rush into my life
Is like waiting for the seacrest to reach the base of the mountains 
So instead I will stand and shift the earth
Or my feet which ever gives first

    





Waiting Beside Self

Here one day
Wait, perhaps the next

Waiting is a most conscious thing
Though it's not me anymore

I don't want to wait another second
Without starting this conversation

    





waiting for the hint of a spark

when darkness comes 
with every closing day in eyes 
and we must face, about-face 
the restlessness of our untrusting lives 
it's in arms and beds and promises 
in which we hope to hold and sometimes find 
a kindly, sorted, trusted self 
a bed on which we all must lie

    





Waiting Here

More patient than a memory
In ambitiousness and steadfast true 

You are far too fair and yet too close
To be felt alive 

Too afraid perhaps of the awkwardness again 
To be seen by each other and to renew 

Yet it's not just I who can see this end
It's pursuit so nearing us through and through 

Arise my old language
Arise and breathe life 

Over a thousand days died here waiting away
Just as I too have waited for you

    





Waiting In A Dark Room

I'm waiting in a dark room
When it would be brighter just outside 
I speak and sing, but sound nothing like a tune
And I hope that my ears, and especially my eyes
Never fully adjust to this life of mine 

Because I am waiting on the receiving end 
Of an empty and uncertain line 
Like a phone cord wrapped around my wrist 
I tell myself that it’s no crime 
To wait for what I hope would be mine

    





Waking Up A Dream

Pull me out of the threads 
Like a ragdoll willing
Almost excited to climb the cotton mount
And fall with goose feathers down

Sacrifice a fruit on the alter of passion
But do not deny me this one little thing
This basic, simple, moment left 
To let my head fall ever down

And when I wake from such a falling out
And my time spent surfing on goose feathers runs out
Would you bend the rules of time for me?
Would you unwind the clock with parts ferocity on the ground?

Because even if you must
I beg of you
I plead 
Please don't make me wakeup to this morning now

    





Waking Up To Snowflakes Large

This morning I 
Awoke
To a field of snow
Falling slowly as the sunset
Somehow
More radiantly than the dawn
And I
In the seeing all of this 
Suddenly 
With the sleep still in my eyes 
Remembered 
That I was free
And that the snow born wisps 
Which hold no name
Were also me

    





Walk

Walk to the end of the road
And turn
Walk, not till you find yourself
Or your place
But walk because thought
Because stillness kills
We are walking beings
At pace

    





Walk Along

No mention of stars or sea
Or of sky or song
Or of rivers reaching 
Roads winding
Or of trees singing quietly 
As we walk along
None of it lasts 
Nearly half as long
Or compares to the truth
Within the pursuit of you
As we walk along

    





Walk And Walk Again

Marriage is a newfound island 
A purchased continent 
Walk all your life and you will not find
Or know every single inch of land

Walk and walk again

    





Walking Away

Someday I'll walk down this dusty road,
And you'll never again see the likes of me. 

Amidst my flight I won't turn around,
I won't even be tempted to take a glance back at you, my history. 

Because you are nothing more to me than a memory. 
Which is stored away inside the cavity I call my mind. 

I would pass you by in another life, 
Because you do not value the values of mine. 

I lied, I tried, and sacrificed the important parts of me to try, 
And complete the whole of you inside. 

When really this wasn't my place to stay, 
And the soles of my shoes were just passing through. 

At the end of this road, I will keep my word, 
I will walk away, slowly from you.

    





Walking Beneath the Branches of Realizations

There is no time left in my life 
     For fitted dreams and windless sheets 
     For trees without low limbs to climb 
     For years without ever seeing the sea</em> 

There is only that</em> which stands here between
     The hopes
     The plans
     The quiet dreams</em>

And yet I find, in the eyes of mind and present being ⁠⁠— And for the sake of those who walk beside 
     That there ought to be more in me to find

    





Walking Shoes

You think I'm used to being me? 
You think I'm comfortable in these shoes?
Walking time and time again,
Down that old hallway, without you? 

Well I'm not. 
But ironically enough
No longer do I expect you
Or anyone for that matter
To tell me how to be myself

To tell me which shoes to buy or to wear
Because I simply walk
As I once was taught 
And always will

To stride alongside with a loving air
Until I find the most tolerable pair, of shoes
The most close to comfortable I can bear

By which I mean of course
A very inspiring and impressive pair
Because a man needs good walking shoes
If he is to live his life some-wear

    





Walking Through And Thru

It was always this way but you never knew that, did you? 
Even now as you walk through my world on a whim 
On your own terms because you can't handle mine
My own colors and their dark crashing imbued 
Shine as a single sunset this particular way
But you never saw it as such
And I know it to be so

    





Walk With Me

Would you meet me beneath the smiling moon?
Would you put on your favorite tennis shoes
And walk with me?
Not into it, but through the night

Would you drift here with me side by side
Most innocently?
Just to break with me from the daily grind
Of walking along this followers line?

Could we walk in stride for once in time?
And talk about all the things in life 
Which supersede the most basic need
The desire to simply run and hide?

Let the goodness of your lovely thoughts
Wash over me and float with ease
Above the trees until the moon is really smiling
And so am I with an effortless ease

If we could meet beneath the smiling moon
Just for tonight 
Would you walk with me?

    





Wallpapering Words

The real wallpaper isn't plastered 
It's ongoing and expressed 
Pulled out of the nothing of tongue and cheek
And unknown until it finds itself
At home at last
Surrounded on these four sides 
The walls which we keep

</em>*No thought is heard until it is spoken

    





Want

Want is not of the most natural, always
And in line with the intended almost never found
Beneath the trees or above the sky
You'd be more in lost finding 
Searching words for books
For in losing this you will surely find

    





Wanting More

Quite coffee
Warm looks through 
And cold seats no-more alone 
And in knowing of such
Warm up to you
Quiet as your opinion of me may be
In memory 
It's what I want more than any such truth 

At least at present

    





Wanting Vs. Waiting

I'm fighting against my heart
In secret
I know it to be true
That I could just show up 
At your door 
And kiss
But no
That wouldn't be fair to either of us
Especially you

    





Wants And Needs

I want to know that there's hope
I want to know that there's a future
I want to see that there's a sustainable place in her heart for me
And yet, if that's not the case
I need to learn what I need and can
And then I need to leave

    





Warm and alone in the wooded wilds (free)

Do you ever find yourself
(when beneath canvasing trees)
Standing alone in the singular comforting heat
Of the of the only illuminant rays to find
Their way through the clouds of leafy green?

Do you? I did 
And it felt so immaculate to be
Warm and alone in the wooded wilds
Where I was free

    





Warm Embrace

Reaching out, 
I pull her closer to me than ever, 
Her back to my front as we mold together. 

Like a pair of spoons on a table top, 
My arm around her waist to stop her every shake.
Embedded in my warm embrace. 

I hear her breath caress the air, 
And smell the fragrance of her hair. 
Little does she know that I desire whatever scent she wears. 

Obscured by shadows her sleeping face. 
I need not see to know that she, 
Is in love at least with my embrace. 

So tender and so tremendous. 
Her warmth the most magnificent, 
Of every feeling to be expressed. 

By sleeping beauty I'm the beast, 
Her heart a steady soothing beat. 
Though intoxicating as she may be, 
I only desire her next to me.

Don't wake me please from such a dream, 
For she is the fairest girl I've seen. 
With longing eyes of crystalline, 
And a whisper soothing as a stream. 

How could I ever let her go, 
Perhaps if somehow she did know. 
That my embrace holds all of me, 
And to break that bond is to shatter me.  

Though the clock may say it's time to leave. 
I hope that in my embrace she'll stay, 
Forever right here next to me.

Warming Words Leaned Into

There is a differing motive
In the can and should
Fire should burn just as match can strike
Just as no heat is guaranteed in this human life

No ways unturned in this cloister of if
And in the conversations felt
All that is good and honest and impressive 

This is warmth, when really
Can should not always be as should
Just as sould is not being the detail

    





Was One Of Few, Am

If anything be known
Be it by memory or reflex of habit fine 
It was once and for a midnight shone 
For a spell of time and worth 
That there is coal and those who burn 
And he a diamond in the earth

Shining

    





Waste

I pour it out
Like a bottle of wine upon the ground
I have spent myself therein 
And soaked into the bitter ground
Behind the house 

Because no expectation can withstand 
The truth within
Which is that you can control the consumptive means
To make or break most anything

But I pour it out 
Because I can

    





Watching Rivers

It's like I spend my life
Speeding through rivers
With the occasional wade or float
But when I sit and let the water catch me up
My life no longer flies
Instead the world passes me by
For a change

    





Watching The Atlantic At Night With You (a tanka)

It's September veiled 
And Atlantic shale beneath
And saltwater words
In the presence of those who
No longer need breath to speak

    





Watching The Waves

If each wave on the sea
Was but a single life
We would all come crashing down
Around the knees of our children's lives

    





Waterfalls

Alluring eyes like waterfalls flow right on by 
See not the graffiti on the rocks 
But the beauty which resides 
Deep inside her watery eyes

    





Water Over Stones Smoothing (A Tanka)

Listening waters 
Breathe and flow as breath being
Chest heaving under
Sound of streams and rocks smoothing
Over current ears which hear

    





Wavering, A Haiku

My open window
Behind a closed curtain breeze
Just a hint I AM

    





Waves

Life is one wave
After the other
And the swells and lulls
In between

    





Waves, Fire, A Tanka

Noone says goodbye 
At the beach and yet expects
The waves to stay back
For more than a crashing day
As they burn by waterside

    





waves of crashing honesty

Receding. 

No ocean says, "I want to give way to a strong and crashing love." It doesn't have the time to burn and not churn. It has already landed on the shore, and back again.

    





Waving Waters (fourth love)

We love the sea
For her deep impartial parts
Which demand respect and remember fear

    





We Are All Rivers

Ashes and wind
Dust and sand 
In quiet and wishes and yet to knows 

Just as with a snowfall your nothing begins
And happens upon our truth by happenstance 
It is with melting direction which we flow 

Unseen until our steady decline has since passed us by 
We are all rivers in the sense of I 
Attempting to lead ourselves to an ocean somewhere far below

    





We Are Like Stars Ever Falling Down

Just as birds envy trees for how they never seem to leave
And trees envy birds for how they move around

Deep waters envy shallows, and the shallows envy the dark abyss 

And the stars, the stars, they envy us
Because we get up from our burning existence
And breathe after every time we fall down

    





We Are Ocean Minded People

You’ll have to let me know,
How long that fragile peace will last.

How long you’ll be content with not knowing why something bothers you,
And why such thoughts will not settle and pass.

Would you let me know then, and how that was? 
So that I can say, I've been there as well.

For the truth is that, most people are meant, but not for us. 
Such people are nice, but not enough. 

That is, in time.
They are dulcet and sweet, but cannot satisfy the vastness, or thirst of an ocean mind.

    





Weariness

A man can only fight so many battles
Be it known

Let so many days run into themselves 
Before he remembers who he is
And is home

Even humans must sleep beneath God and sun
Hear songs in the wind when they are walking out

At the courtship an end with a breathless noise
Comes light and truth, not dark for long

    





Weathering A Memory Cold

I don’t bleed for you
Burn or in weeping fall like rain
With closed eyes or with headwinds sway 
But like stars glistening 
With night sky coldly watching
I am reminded
And think of you often 
In a bright minded sort of way

    





Weaving

Such moments are not gone forever, they will return. 
They are on hiatus. 
Taking a break from the stranded places in the tapestry of life. 

I am weaving, working my way onward. 
Walking the path towards a certain someone. 
Who someday I might just be able to call my own, my wife.

    





We Dream Of Faces Already Seen

Your face was far more pleasing than 
The dream of seeing almost surreal 
So I slept away and slept away
To see you again
But for the life of me now
In this warm awkward hour afterwards 
I cannot remember where I saw your face
The first time and for real

No dream was ever happenstance

    





We Humans Ignore, Based On What We Want

Fear not

Concurred worlds such as these, incurred
Stretch out only in mind
And thorough constant memory
And considerable adaptation, often hold 

As the army of creation marches on 
Towards the rounded everloving demise of me
So this uniformity of us marches there without toll

Paying nothing 
Saying nothing

And to no one
In particular 

We grow old before we can realize that fear
Held nothing but the bitter cold

    





Well As Well

I’m torn between sharing the mass
Of stones I’ve dropped to the bottom of the well
And keeping the precious water supply all to myself 

Because it’s not against my beliefs to drink
Or to share with someone a drink as well

But to pollute my own most trusted source of outpouring 
Will take a confidence in me
The kind which ought but doesn’t always swell

    





we'llsprings

We are springs of refreshing mind
Reaching out 
From the cooling rock and reaping soil 

Not cloud and thunder
Oak and root 
Or spring and flower without song 

Not star or fire
Grass or mire
Or ocean rumbling as a throng 

Yet it's down below from which we pool
The thoughtful self most fulfilling 
From which we ought to base and pull

    





Well Wishes and Hopes

Hope beyond all hope to be
Smile in earnest objectivity

Stand aside
Walk away
Drink a tall alone in stay with room for milk

And scribble furiously at me
Be it not at all

For within some distance
Far away
As a hope for me I feel called to say

Or with half an ask

That I hope though know that you're okay

    





We Rooks

Not one to fly in another's sky
Nor to fish the grounds of another herrings town
For I
I am a Rook
Meaning that often and alone I fly
Not high, but above
More pleasant fowl
For as keen eyes look
And occasionally see alone
With pinions dark as covered night
There is noone else at last to be found
Because we rooks, we mate for life
There is noone else for us alive

    





We Used To Walk Each Autumn Fair

It’s been a long time since
the sound of you came back to me
In an echo so fierce like the roaring trees 
and embedded deep itself within wooded mind

Albeit growing towns and in doubt maybe
You are still eternal in stillness and air 
Like moth wings ever felt unseen 
and mulled ciders reckoning

Like a street vendor fair 
How you always unroll the sidewalks clean 
and walked out of us as far as eyes could be seen 
Until carnival sounds were at backs and finally at ease 

How the sound of you came back to me
without so much as a whisper spent 
On this, these prattling autumn trees 
No songs remind or need I see

    





We've Become The Body

The body never truly falls
Be it completely forward or back on itself
Because the body is so much bigger than just the one
Made up of ones nonetheless 

When one man stumbles
Though it may reflect in small and personal pools of running water beneath 
His falter is not of the body, the whole
For we are as one, and made up of ones
And when one man stumbles in his walk
Another man will always be there
To step up and catch his fall

For as he was in full, once one
Now we are in full, many as one

With him our unity never truly falls

    





We've Never Met But...

Park bench sitting
Hands aching 
Side-by-side

As strangers ask
Quiet questions pass
Like cotton seeds

As an opportunity
The breeze 
Passes us by

Blown
Shoot

    





We Want What We Think

Desire is the strongest drug
Noone can tame
Nor wants to try

For once embedded
And for real
It's seemingly forever there in mind

Even if it's only a memory now

It was

    





We Were Eighteen

When Fabienne plays the harmonica
In that gently abiding way
My head turns ever so slight with memory
And my eyes gleam anew with river sheen
Walking down a path called contentment 
I smile, and for a moment stay

    





What A Man Sees

More delicate
And yet stronger in such ways
Unbeknownst to me
And this is why
When I look into her eyes
I see nothing of me
And yet everything 
I could ever wish to know

    





What And If

Choose WHAT the you of yous thinks you wants
Though you will not want it all the time
On the contrary
The goal will be not to be set free from yourself
But to not question the IF within your mind

    





What A Slight Smile Means

Near not
Nor want of desires am
Be told as much by their fathers 
Less 
For fear of a girl expecting more suns 
For expecting stars without such burning 
Infinitely falling duress

We are not them
Human which tears apart parting flesh 
Nor timeless clocks or flea ridden pests
When wondering in east 
Be confounded by the floundering boundless this 
That we are but men 
Infused with Gods lost compasses

Near not, you’ll find
That behind the guise 
We smile and acquiesce

    





What Envy Looks Like

Envious
Is a deep word
Meaning more than envy itself
Envious is craving your feet on the other side of the world
Where no road ends
When the same rain falls
And when all things turn inevitably
For better or worse
We are all on the same green Earth

    





Whatever It Is

You invade my dreams
Mix with the past

Sounding like an angel
That's not you

But whatever it is
It's holding fast

    





What He Does

There is a self amongst confusion
A sewing madman obsessed with lines 
Who quietly, secretly
Wishes for nothing more than quiet 
And the resulting therein 
Which goes along with 
The breaking of time

    





What I Am

I'm not a well you can just keep drawing water from
I'm not the sky because the rain will not always come

I'm not the earth, I am the opposite 
I am a man, I am alive

And I'm in love or could've been
If it hadn't taken you this long to try

    





What I Am Is Not

I'm not what I want
...What I'm doing
...Where I've been
I'm not a metaphor or dream
I'm not a wish or sudden whim
I am in passing and in kind
I am a thought perceived
A wish perhaps
But most of all I'm you becoming
For having since gone and read me in mind

(exist anew)

    





What I Know Of Youth

I would not recommend 
Again
The yearning for younger
Stupider days
As we all did own version of foolish
(In youth)
Be it in our own being
And stupid way

Too old, too soon?
Perhaps

But the fast well known
Is a far better day

    





What It Feels Like

I am an outstretched arm with a fibrous grain. 

I am a whooshing, waving, slashing glaive. 

Waiting to cut the wind with a bending sway. 

And with a gleam of blue the ball darts away.

    





What It Is

Loneliness is the realization that all of your friends and family have married. Long before you have tamed and owned your own expectations regarding reality.

    





What It's Like

Better than any disconnect 
Any night of sleep 
Any day of unease 
Better still is the pouring of water
On an eventual seed
Which will turn with the sun in the sky
Into a creative tree 
Which grows and thrives above my eyes
Better it is than any of these

    





What It's Like To Forget Sense

I touch but do not feel
I see seeing only mind
I know until I know no more
I grasp but hold no time complete
The seeing, touching, knowing kind
Of better still 
Is not my best sense, but it is mine

    





What It Wants

Can you truly dictate the direction in which you will walk? 
Change the manner of your subconscious ways 
And develop yourself into a new role? 
What of your mind, what of your body? 
Can you bend such things to a fuller health 
And channel your will for the good of yourself?
Not to mention the collectiveness of this 
You and your futures mutual souls 
And for those of you who are yet apart
And wandering further down the path
Only wondering what the future holds 
You can relax and know that it has been decided
Because the heart will want what it will want
It's inevitable

    





What Makes You Worth Forgetting

How little do I think of you? 
So little that I will delete this soon, 
Just to erase all living memory of you. 
You deserve no such words more than two.
Forgotten now,
Forgotten are you.

    





What Pulls Me Away, A Tanka

The world is ruined 
By this turning of unsee 
No event twisted 
Un let me be and beneath 
Near this gravity to me

    





What She Is

Some days I miss her,
But I’d never tell her this. 

Because you know what it is that I really do miss? 
I miss only my thoughts about what it is that she is. 
And the curve of her waist, the distort of her hips. 

And at the end of the day the only thought left is this...
I can tolerate this, 
Because I don’t really want what she really is.

    





What The Feeling Feels Like

I am thunder
Silver fire
Felt like a hot tin roof beneath young feet
And scolding
Smoking like the copper wire
Paper on a guillotine 
Slicing through an echo chamber
I am the terror of a plastic souls desire

That is
Until only bane of self remains
And all once again are made the same

    





What These Battles Felt Like

In war at least there is an end

When body breaks along with luck
And wingless time refuses to fly

When stranded ground is found and crossed
With your enemies advancing under a sun
Their cries no longer lies 

Defeated when 
The clouds are stroked with arrows down
And your knees know sunset shown
In the distance 

Lay it down 
Long tired warrior
Stop existing for an hour or so
And simply 
Let it all go

    





What Writing Is Like Today

I write like I am your underwater
There in awe of not being
No longer of earth
Once fully submerged 
I see but cannot breathe a word
About anyone but myself in secret
And then suddenly my words run dry
Bursting forth into sandy existence 
And I'm out

    





What You Ought

The answer is not
To wander 
To lose one’s self in the wondrous thought
Or to throw precaution the wind

No

One answer which will travel much farther 
Is to simply do 
Whatever it is 
You ought

That which you can

    





When

When words sprout limbs
And grow as trees in the summertime 
Steadily until they bare their fruit
Then my thoughts will be hanging within reach
Would you pluck them as you'd pluck some fruit?
And take a tiny bite of me
Or at least of my thoughts?
Would you, wouldn't you?

    





... When

... When I'm writing I am torn apart
     I am there more less than me 

... When I'm fearful that my heart's exposed 
    And too disclosed, in such moments I am free 

... When her topic weighs upon my mind
    And no self-thought will settle me 

... It is when I write, I don't know I've found
    That I create what I've yet to see

    





WHEN

When the first summer rain stirs the peaceful veil
And the white fly casts shadows down tried and true
When the firelight sparks in the first dark of night
And the thunderous call reaches the mountains through

Within grandeur ends such glory
A quiet death for time as it stops

Crashing like passing waves ashore
Bursting into the creative mind

That is the caffeine rushing to a combustive heart

    





When a falling star catches you

Such a human concept

For when you wish on physical stars 
(which exist) -
For so long that 
You wouldn't know what to do if you caught one
I'll tell you this -
At 3,500K, you wouldn't be so quick to wish

Maybe tell your lover
"I summoned you from an ocean stare" instead

Much cooler

    





When (again)

Time stopped and stared back then
With eyes wide in disbelief
And you couldn't hear anything
Because nothing dared to drop from the trees
In the presence of such quiet uniformity

    





when alone is said

my saying I'm alone by me
is like saying that the stars have no sky
because the night cannot breathe so deeply this far into the galaxy

    





When a man tries

When when a man
In his own way tries
To make the stars align 
And without so much as a twinkle
You, refuse to remotely,
Like young Torrence, shine
Than dont be surprised if
He, doesn't bend his back to mountains
Or sets foot in the great ocean divide 
If you, in your own eyesight up
Didn't want to see his time

    





WHEN - A poem about the human perception

When the sun and moon and stars align
And the darkness is most bitter sweet
On the backside of our turning time
With inches meaning less and less
It's where our two perspectives meet

And when the rolling river cuts its path
Down beneath the deep, the grand abyss
As the ages pass on through and trough 
That's when I will recant
That’s when I will return to you

For as the arrows fly and pass you by 
So the winds of change flow steadily on 
Both forward and through every tree
Yet inching towards to former fount 
Only when in stillness will I ever be 

For it's between this heaven and this earth 
Between the sun and moon and land and sea
It is WHEN we only care about
When it ought to be the man to be 

Heaven our impatience
Earth our wonder
Wind a wandering mind to keep
Between is no other

    





When : Becoming (1)

When you decide to fight
To battle back against the night and it's dying ways
Having seen the light which comes anew
To trump the lights of ever eave
When you've decided no longer to RUN but to BE
You will become as one
With every memory and hopeful dream
Which your childlike self ever dared to dream

    





When Dreams Are The Only Replacement You Seek

Weary isn't the half of it
Behind this driving mind of which I've been

On a selfish quest and road trip bent 
To distant spires by the sea
Where my timeful eyes can review and see

So many things

For she knows me well my feverish being
And remembers me still, that is until
The relentless Saturday morning thrush
Which knocks and wakes me inbetween 

Ever pulling me from my feverish dream
Which I love as well with which to be

And so my dear, unless you are here
And within my thusly joining reach
With a quiet door and a will to speak

IF, but if not then all I ask is this 

Don't wake me from this compulsive scene
Just let me live until you're live
For a little bit longer within dreams

    





When : Eclipse (2)

When you stand in the doorway
Beautifully outlined by its brightly lit rays
Your curves an eclipse of immaculate Dawn
The sight of you alone brings new contrast to day

    





When Home Isn't Home (Go)

Too much time
Not enough air
Stale paling walls and melted snow 
Sometimes home is the one place to which you cannot go
The one thought of which you dare not revisit in there

    





When I feel unkind

We are all beings alike
And of opposite nature

Like wood and sand paper
Like true grit and true lies

We are distant and on top of 
Each one another as neighbors

And to judge a persons beliefs
Is the epitome of crime

With a nice bow wrapped up
So that we all can understand 

(Who the real villain is)

When in truth we fall, all as one, aligned
For we are human beings of the most unkind

    





When I'm Free On Earth

Lost in a car ride roadside song 
Joyous with praise in the halls of his days
Carried through the well-known words by unfamiliar ways found 
And when I lay my head down
I am free 
On earth

    





When I'm In The City

I'm not the shadow 
I'm the wall casting quietly
My lengthy in a New York alley, temporal 

So my time is spent beautifully 
And in my own way, passing

    





When In Doubt, Live In Joy

In the stillness near
In the quiet hours of the meadowing deer

In the mourning pain
In the dead of night
In the dawns first crowning and tremulous sight

In the hopes you've handled
In the truth you can't hold
In the courage of every story untold

In these passing seconds
In every here and now
In all these questioning memories of why and how

In the eldest of them
In the youngest of you
In the heart of each moment spent silent and true

In the coffee to stir
In the brewing of cups
In the lofty ambitions spent star gazing up 

In the light of the son
In the shade of the moon
In the inevitably of all things too soon

In the echoing mind
In the shell of the self
In the prominent values set high on the shelf

In the breath of your speech
In the fog drawing near
In the timeless long hours which encompass the years

In the youth of your springtime, with your fate every stay 
In the Spirit I find you and from joy never stray

    





When In Love

BE, like a quiet wind through the cattails. BREATHE, like a cloud in the minds sky.

SOUND, like a hallway in the grandest library. And TRUST, like parachute lines. 

HEAR, like the rustling deer in the bitterroots. HUM, like it's noone you'll find. 

SLEEP, like the deep pooling waters of green. And SIGH, as if he were only there in mind.

    





When I Saw You I Knew

Keep your distance,
Don’t get too close.
Enjoy the pure unfiltered happiness.

Soak it in from around the bend,
And imagine once more to begin again. 
With someone new…

So many eyes, so few to see,
The future as it unfolds before you.
The want, the yearning, 
The most basic human need. 

Close your eyes, but do not blink.
Imagine yourself already there,
Yourself within in which you think.  

This scene you see,
Couldn’t possibly be, 
Someone else’s life passing before your eyes?
Or potentially your life just passing you by? 

Calmly, slowly, most beautifully.
Are you to be sight within this scene?
  
Eventually your eyelids blink, 
Though rare enough for anyone.
A wink and smile just might be seen.

When I saw you I knew, 
I belonged in your scene.

    





When It's Time

When the faces repeat,
And you rinse and lather the imaginary relationships between.

It is time.</em>

When you no longer care about anything but a smile and a wave. 
And the real relationships are laid bare before you.

It is time.</em>

When you're too close to the fire and know you it is so. 
By the smell of your smoldering self-realized ego.

It is time.</em>

When the moments have passed and the omens you knew, 
Which have been good tor you, for so long, are now gone. 

*Yes, it is time to go.

    





When left alone

There's absolutely no proof
That if left alone
Human beings will be
Or course correct more than anyone
Who have lost themselves 
Most resoundingly at sea

If anything we
Need more guidance than ever
In this time of being most encouraged to be

Whatever we feel
Whatever we dream

When really we are actually not at all these things

We are just that which sees
Humans who be

    





When left is alone

Which is louder
   ?  

   The silence
   You create 
   For yourself
   ? 

   Or the silence 
Left
   When someone else
   Doesn't want 
   To create
   With you
   ?

    





When Poetry Overtakes You

As my archive 
Kept archiving me
With a strong hold
And a seal so great
That in quiet places
I couldn't begin to think
Let alone even meditate 
On what should be done
About these growing words
About flattened seams obese 
And so I'll never again perhaps see
The rushing waters within the streams
Of a most flowing forth into my unseen
And to this I think, that it's alright with me
Having long since looked upon the accepted sea

And accepted such a fate

    





When : Shadows Come (3)

When the realization casts itself like a line or shadow in between
Be it falling fast or stretched out in front with steady meaning
There is no height too high, nor fear too great
No better time or opportune place
There is only this, the height, the fall
And those opposed who choose to jump from such a height
In truth, the fearless never notice their shadow
The fearless jump, they never fall

    





When she probably isn't a stray

Seeing you 
is like seeing raindrops on the pond 

Like the cats fur 
rippling upon the windowsill 

I know where you are
just not when you'll be

    





When She Reminds You Of Pure Starlight

Guided like the steady light
Which call out
Over the vast ocean darkness of mind. 
Clearing clouds in a single bound 
With skying hopes 
And ever leaving leaves
Falling out of favor now.
And down
Quickly towards the earth 
Where I am brought back  
When your night 
It ends. 
As with sentiments drawn 
Renewed embued. 
Are you more than just the light persistent?  
Hiding above the sun's inevitably found? 
Or are you the guiding
Winding
Downward stars?
Don't leave me now
My heart abound.
Without your light 
I'd be in lost.

    





When She Won't Ask Or Speak

Speak me a sound 
  Not so that I can hear
  Or so that you can seem
  To be more interested in me
But speak to my heart
  And appeal to my mind
  And ask questions of my eyes
So that maybe we both could believe 
That one day neither of us could be alone

    





When The Conversation Ends At Night

Smile - Vaguely 
Claiming busyness 
Hide

No one gives me the time of day
That's alright - I like the night

    





when the moon winked at us

Until the sunlight bounced its last light
Off 
Another gleaming face
And we
Looking up amidst the lenses 
Memories bright as burning eyes 
Puddling in skies
Above you see
And when the moon winked at us
Knowingly
We knew that it was alright to love

    





When The Rain Clouds Burst

Where painted rivers pick apart 
The rocks and earthy soil 

Carve bolden paths into meadow lands 
With a crashing winding coil

Puddles form
And land deforms 
Opportunities rise
And tidings fall

As beneath the growing chaos storm
My mind unwound
How I cannot help but be feel now 
When the rain clouds burst on the Texas soil

    





When They No Longer Shine For You

When I used to think about you
It was was with the warmth and intrigue of a friendly fireplace 
The distant respect of a nightlong star in the bright sky 
But now it is only the cold ash and glowing cloud 
Which consumes my night in the direction of you 
For you are no longer in mind of mine 
And I am no longer am to you

    





When You Are By My Side

Valleys, rivers, mountains wide
To great upends and depths of trenches which divide 

No cloud nor star
Nor sun nor gleam 
Or misting fog at last be seen

Neath rock and root
Or oceans wide
Or frozen tundra stretched outside

No warming feeling felt
Abides
Twixt valley, river, and mountainous wide

No distance compares or parts our minds
When you are standing here beside

    





When You Are The Hammer

A clanging, banging, colossus
Creating cavital void until glowing orange apricot 
Bear no more at this youthful age
Before fate of day lets fly another 
Don't wait and fade
Strike hot, hot 
It is the iron and the sound away

    





When You Find Another Mind Which Sees

You speak
And I hear my beliefs 
Together 
Is a powerful thing to be 
Be it only in hope and sight

    





When you must. But you don't want to.

Don't make me risk,
The bitter end.

Don't make me try,
Though I will again.

    





When Your Cellphone Dies

Sometimes to disconnect from the world
You need to realize
That although (you're alone)
You are forever most a human
Not a planet in and of yourself

    





When You're Looking At The One

Every wooden sanded edge
Every rippling river smooth with skipping stones 
And metal ridges sharper than swords well-hewn
The kind which pierces even the heavens reign 
And pours down thunder like an autumnal coat
I know, I know, of even such a place
Where the summers howl and the winters winds
Gently blow out candlelight stars below 
And there also you will find such out
In the pouring of the heart and soul
I am the one
No doubt

    





When You Remember How To Breathe Again

Belief is underrated I find
And believing in is strong
Like the sunlight glistening off the wings of setting birds, believe 
And so it will be 
Shimmering and reflected in our most human kind of song
That the way to be happy, is to be
And not to harp on that which has been
Or those who didn't belong

Believe
Be free
Live long

    





When You're Weary But Also Descriptive

When I rest I sleep like water 
Into potting soil newly laid

Into my bed I find myself and fold
Like ironed sheets and cabernet 

I dry and dry my desert eyes
On quiet silk
Unwind like coils and fade away

Like the distant colors of a prefixed sun
As its dullest emerald glow
Is slowly polished with grey

Until all that's left is the sleepless ore 
Black as opal jewel with organic shine

I am tirelessly writing myself away
On smooth rocks from a vibrant stream

And all I want are mountainsby

    





When You Walk On By

As you walk on by
I forget about being
And in this unknowing seeing
What it means to not breathe for an instant 
And for a heart to stop beating so suddenly

As if in the middle of a cold river running
You are a full stop for tumbling me
Before cascading into a crescendo fall
With a humming of sound 
And a harmonica drum

Lost is a wonderful place to be
Near you

    





When You Want Someone More Than Your Own Space

Saying that I’m selfish    with you
    Is an understatement of time
Such as it’s not worth mentioning
    A waste
Such an obvious case    of want    and wanting

    





Whereas...

It takes a quiet mind to sit and listen, to live this life slowly.

An insatiable appitie is an aggressive death, desire to express and to capture the expression wherever it stands.

    





Where Bodies Meet (A Tanka)

And then suddenly
With tremendous presence born
New territories
Open up to your old self
To be shared excitedly

    





where harp and heart become haiku

the harp of my heart
waits quietly for your breath
breathe into me warm

    





Where He Is

Find him in a corner seat
With a present step and a mind set away
With a drink not to define the style of man
But to open his eyes to another day
With a furious scribble from a gifted pen
How he carves a stone for a future day
An enscription for only the eyes of her
At a coffee shop he chips away

    





Where My Heart Soars In Water

Sink not in oceans 
So much as you swim 
In the unified chorus 
Of Calvary's voice

    





Where My True Voice Resides

If I could carry you between my ears
Record my thoughts, my mind, my ways
For an entire day
I would do so without hesitance
And send them your way
Just as I write 
That way I wouldn’t have to explain and tell you so
In that particular way

    





Where Oceans Collide

That kind of kiss is an intersection 
Like a small stream
Where two oceans meet

How they’ve tossed and turned 
Precariously 
And endlessly 

End over end
Until afterwards 
Experienced vicariously

Like the saltwater winds
Which whip and whirl 
And swirl the sand

So I am turned at the intersection
At the memory which ends 
Where the ocean began

    





Where our obsessions meet.

The noise is not the trees.
Instead, I understand
And stand where life begins
And questions end.
Now comprehend,
What shakes therein.
For that sound is not a noise at all,
It is the wind.

    





Where Puddles Reside

Forget not 
That at the lowest part of the humble path 
Resides the divot 
Which concurs and divides
Not passing feet
But yearns to keep the honest truth
Which is bestowed upon the earth
By means of rain 
Teeming with life and oxygen 
How it tries to keep itself within 
Both without fail, and with inevitability 
Because the water will certainly soak or sway 
But the divot itself will forever stay 
Embedded in the earthly clay 
Beneath our walking feet 
So forget not to tread lightly, ever so
On this, the placid soil underneath

    





Where Rain Meets Water

There’s something majestic about where water meets rains

As body of water seemingly warmer than that of your own

As if the worlds fishbowl had been turned upside-down on a playing card

Where the warm is cold and cold is the air

And all I want to be is in and beneath

The broken, shining surface of this rippling world

Not quiet, not callous, not alone

    





Where The Light Is

Shining bright
On my shoulder blades tonight
Until tomorrow is today
Would you let me stay 
Wherever there is such a light

    





Where The Towers Meet The Sky

Hold my hopes 
Regardless of how high or low
Like the towers in the distance hold the canvas sky above

Standing closer now than the reality of how  
Yearning souls alone call out to be found 
With each other in their one true home 

Don't leave me standing here alone
Don't leave me now

    





Where The Trees Could Never Fall

Whenever here the stars are closer, the Moon is fuller, and the trees could never fall. This is a world away from worlds within, and there's so much here. For me. That I'll never be able to describe it all, or explain therein.

    





Where Words Become Meaning

I peer into the night
The dark of thought 
Of wonderment 
And
Reaching into the vastness 
Of what ought to be the sky 
Pull the dawn into the existence
Of a more familiar set of eyes

    





Whisper, A Tanka

The snow how it flies 
The raindrops which weep and cry
The sunlight rays keep
And the breeze which tries to speak
All have this in common 

(Those things which tell us were alive)

    





Whispers on our bed, together

Deep water found
In a wellspring of being
Would you be, and want
To be refreshed and renewed 
Not as immortal songs
But as the sound of running water
On a washboard bed of stones
Turn over again 
I, in sleeping here, next to you

    





White Fly In June

Quietly falling 
Into the cavernous dark beneath the day...

With a lone ray of light
Dancing a jig to ignite the fly...

As the predator prowls 
Through the underground forest, silently...

So also are my prayers answered
With a furious and foaming bite...

And the fight ensues from there
From there...

    





White Mirrors

I wish you could see these reflections of mine
In my eyes
Like when the snow falls freely down
Careening now
Onto the ground
Past the autumn remnants of my life

    





White Pillow Skye

Your stars never crossed over into my universe 
Not for a second of time shown true 
In the upward skylight of my eyes 

If seeing this is believing in you 
Then I caught only a glimpse 
Of the truth in mind

Yet your stars never crossed over into my universe 
Of which I am over the not of it
And that's alright

    





Who?

Who are you to say the white curtain stains
On a hilltop growing green?

Who are you to paint with such graphite cold
On a white provincial scene?

Who am I to wish for such a thing
Amongst all these eyes unseen?

Who are we to hope for such a sight
For such parted parchment things...

    





Whoever You Are

I'd write a town into existence for you
If you'd just end my agony
And let me be
Me

    





Who I’ve Become

I am a sand sifter
A mountain top metal detector with quiet shoes 
A fly caster 
Comet thrower 
And spitter of flames in deoxygenated rooms 

I am time once sighted
Tree tops withering in the slow sun growth 
And a mere stone’s throw away from diving into the waters called home

I am the feeling of being betwixt despair and hope 
As if all true sand sifting shifters know 
We just go, and by nights’ allure continually comb 

And a comber kicks nothing without a rake

    





Why

A more simple man builds a more complex house 
But as for me and myself, I find 
That I will never be content with myself 
With my motives and mind 
I am ever at odds with the person who I couldn’t be 
That is why I will always try

    





Why Bad Things Happen

The coldness felt
Is the willingness of God
To let it be as we perceive it to be
From our fatalist stance
Be it true or false
It simply is as he allows it to be
Two cords which we cannot coexist
Connectively

    





Why (DRAFT)

You ache due to the most familiar paths 
Known well to feet
And even moreso etched in memory 

More of the same
More of the same

    





Why I Strive

Clueless isn’t the word I seek
But unknowing of such and in such moments 
Untouchable
That is what I strive to be

    





Why I Uninstall

I want to love you
Polished girl
Who's grown from glamourus day of babe
But you
But you
Hold no substance of earth
No brains of your own
No truth to convey 
You take what I give
You take
You take
Giving nothing of yourself
As empty beings, be
And by the way
You are not social in the least

    





Why Shinkai

Shinkai understands light and reflective shadow. The flow of nature, pacing, and time. Capturing distances close, with quiet thoughts aloud, while voicing the humble machinations of the hopeful mind. He applies miles of perspective with both rigid and applicable standards, as well as a **** good ability to create the sublime. He is creator and visionary director in detail. And I admire and aspire all such of his kind. That's why.

    





Why Silence

Your objectivity is worthless
Without experience 
Just as your opinion isn't helpful
When plagued with negativity 
Grow up
(If you would act just this once)
And get some responsibilities

    





Why We Act

It's not a show
It's not a club
It's not a desire or a desired outcome
It's nothing really
It's just humanity
Suffering under the effects of this self provoked curse we call time

    





Why Words Matter

The ocean is grand
The woods are wild
And my eyes are as shallow as the puddles in the summer's rain 

But my words are insufficient 
And my words are inadequate
When it comes to expressing such things 

The trueness of the heart and how it beats  
The clearness of your words and how they ring
Endlessly in my hollow ears

    





Why you should not desire old window feelings

When a window closes
It doesn't mean
That you're banned from the breeze
Or from the appreciate and growingness 
Of the height of trees
No, less is meant by such an explicit shift
When a window closes it only means
That your sight is obscured 
And only partially 

Yes . Your eyes, your sight
Is still free (to be)

    





Wild Lives

Look outside with the brightness that is within my eyes. 

Taste the tea that is warm and sweet. Vanilla flavored. 

Hear the song playing within my ears. It resonates.

As the songbirds fly in the Cloudy skies overhead.

The leafing trees waving eagerly, bidding that we both step outside. 

Into the woods and wild lives of other eyes. 

Don't be afraid of the unborn seed. It germinates. 

Growing us both taller than the trees. 

For love is in the sights and scenes which we both have seen.

    





Wind Beyond

The wind, a blessing,
gifts me this -
I can hear the trees
from all the way behind glass doors 
such as these

    





Winding Rivers

HUMAN WORLDS 
are like sips of whiskey

GODS WORLD
is like the first Great River.

MY WORLDS
are because of my thirst 

AND HIS WILL BEYOND THIS WORLD
will flow forever
through the valley of eternal consciousness

    





Windows

The more I look 
The more I see 
But do not necessarily understand 
Why is such a simple thing
So much of a surprise to me?

    





Windows Are

The perfect form of imagery 
They're clear but not 
They are but not 
Visible but not directly in front of us 
A marvel of modern society 
A symbol of something
Safe and deadly 
Broken but whole
Reflective in all 
A monument of our mastery...

**** it Bill Gates

    





window searching, ever seeing

The only windows
   which appeal to me
Are the two of gleaming intrepid green 
        which I see in you

    





Windowsill

That moment by a windowsill when you're looking through a shade

At a different world outside yourself and yet inside remains the same

Do not wonder about what could've been or worry about the other way

Instead let time and seasons pass, good memories come, and bad memories fade away

    





Windy Feels

A human feeling
When left alone
Has no more significance 
Than a breeze unseen
Than a wood no longer at ease

But how a human being can howl
And whip round a small meadow of community 
When they are displeased 
And feeling ever powerless in their small being

What an unseen sight indeed
By their own feelings trapped
If they'd just set themselves free

It is sad 
To not see

):

    





Wings within

There are days when I, could swear that my, wings were live, and wide awake, from another life. And I there find, 
[{(within myself)}]
the flight of which I always knew, I had throughout all the of sky’s placed before me.

    





Winter Break

If you were here
I’d take the day
And you on a tour
I’d carve your name into the snow
Instead of hers 
We’d rewrite history and revisit these
The songs which have yet to be sung 
Together anew

    





Winter Man, Alone

Every time the fondness knocks 
I hear an echo
Open up the door to snow 
And find no summer joy 
For guess is me

    





Winters End (April)

Do your eyes still flair
As a Winter ocean
When the snow reflects this cloudy haze

Does it matter
Still
As all winters settle and must end in such rainy days

April 
Id give any one of these mountains for you
Just to hold a piece of your heart again

    





Winter Speed

Chaos folded into a blade
Paired and piercing air and fury wave
With downward motion
For a spell once cast
Is tumblingon
As you are electric on ice
Flying for mere moments in this
Breaking the conceptualized time with forget

    





Wisdom, A Haiku

A wise man will say
Such days are an illusion
Such lies are well lived

    





Wisdom, Knowledge, Thought, A Kiss

Know not what you know, it's true
   Though thoughts are yours
      Are concepts such? 
         Is learning found?
            Be it breathed inward by yourself
         Or with locking lips
      No such life and thought
   Must first be instilled by this teaching within you
Ew

    





Wish

Did you know
That wishes reside
Behind the eyes

Just to the one side
Ever so slight

Like a magic trick within the mind 
We wish
And sometimes forget 

Or remember such wishes
In due time

    





Wishes And Dreams

As subconscious is in mind on earth
So also is this resting deep
Like a wish embedded within a dream
The kind of thing you can't wake up from
And don't want to
Such mountains are too glaringly big to be seen

    





Wishes Break

I can see the way you'd remeber me
So clearly in my mind awake 

I can see the truth before me fall
And into self and to its pieces break

    





Wishes Reign

If I could show you the depths of my heart. The softness of my voice when the trees are in ears, and my thoughts aligned and unified like the stars. 

If I could share with you just an hours time, I would give to you...no, grant you this. A passage through the valley of mind where the still light shines.

If I knew you better I'd still be afraid. 
If I knew you less I wouldn't be scared. 

Because as confusion, and wishes, and unspoken thoughts rain down like the April days which fell away. So also does my head now fall in earnest hope, that your words, however few, will never be stripped away.

    





Wishful Sight

If I could ask one thing of you
Make one wish
It would be that one day you would see this sight
Exactly as it is 
Just like this
Standing atop this former mountain
Looking down into the valley of change
For miles and miles 
Just to witness it
To view this world 
Not as it once was or could’ve been
But for the beauty of the fading mist
For the aching, moaning, weeping wood 
Which cries out for eyes
Which slowly degrades as the hilltop fades
Beneath the last few rays of light 
As the day succumbs to the edge of night 
Know that all that I want for you is to see
What it is, what it was 
And what I suspect that it means 
At least to my eyes and the likes of me 
From this hilltop I wish you could see

    





Wish Of Mind

How dare he, discover these:

     The intimacy before its time
     The constant revelations 
     Untangling and revealing themselves 
     Slowly over the course of passing time</em> 

How jealous still at last am I? 
To be on the outside looking in
Wishing that I could be within 
For the discovery of such things in mind

    





With A Certain Flow

Dashing hopes on rocks below
Like running waters
- Wishes flow
So gently along
Like innermost thoughts
And outermost desires known
Flirtatious and smooth -
You float up to me
Like an ocean floor unglued
And you offer me depths 
(Implied in tastes)
Of that which you do not yet know
As you are still just a meadow stream
And all you do over rocky shoals
Is flow

    





With A Night Sky Inhale

Breathe in the stars each night
Like fireflies
To give my heart the company it needs 
To beat and with pattered wings flee

    





With A Rain And A Smile

When the sky opens up 
And waves to us 
With a rain pouring down 
In a heart felt sound
Be you sure and smile back 
Till the sky's collapse
As each rain is a drop
In a wave quick to pass

    





With A Ripple I Change

My hopes were lower than the floor of city puddles
Until, until
The sunlight came which was your name
And evaporated me into the clouds
And now all that's left is the little sounds
Of the new me falling all around

With a ripple I change
Becoming rain

    





With A Smile. I Don't Miss You. (:

The most beautiful words my former self said 
Echo in memory 
And in painted mind shine 
An unapologetic sun glows bright in the sky 
And I'm blessed with the sight 
Of "I don't"

    





With A Woosh Of Air

I cannot help 
But feel the feeling 
That our trains have passed 
In the dead of night
One before the other
Ever so slight

    





With Eyes Unopened

So my memories tell me
"Wow indeed"
Because she kissed like it was with the last breath of eternity

    





With Hammer And SoleI

Dispell all fears
By writing them on rounded rocks 
By crushing your own selfish doubt
And walking on the pieces beneath
Until the uncertainty stops

This is how you change the eyes
First you change the mind abrupt

    





Within A Cup

Erupt 
Explode into a blue crater 
And mushroom cloud 
Into a condensed atmosphere

Turn no more
Than a morning clock
But simmer still
In firey fear

Warm heat 
Cold whisps 
In a circling mixing
Upward fall

Dark coffee 
Napalmed into cream
To the taste responsible 
To call

    





Within The Eyes

My memories are not special
They are not unique 
But they are mine 

And though imperfect
They're all that I have 
To reference these more confusing times 

And after I’ve lived them once or twice
I store them away within my mind

Not just for me
But also for you 

So that one day you can look back and see
All that it once meant to be
Alive within the eyes of Me

    





Within The House Of My Heart

Everytime I write, I write to prove something to myself. To reassure me and my kind that not all of thoughts are meant to stay inside of this head, this house, this old heart of mine. 

Which is not to say that my thoughts could not be better expressed in some other way. As a matter of fact in the past they have. Which is why for years they did decline and always prefered to stay inside, to enjoy the corridors of a more well known mind. 

And yet every day somehow I pull my thoughts and have them placed here now. Having warned them many years ago, that one day they would have to be more... Sociable, and honest with the world about where they would like to go. 

Because if you only keep your thoughts to yourself, how can those around you be expected to help? As you press and press for something else, and somehow try and prove to yourself, that you can flip your own mind inside out and share about all that you create anew.  

It is the head within the house of my heart which knows these sentiments to be true.

    





Within The Leaves, Beneath The Trees

I feel so tired 
I can barely breathe 
My chest is concave
Like the narrow dell 
Soaking up the rain
And pulling in the leaves 

And though I’m not hollow 
I am not whole 
And though I’m weary
It is not my soul
Which cries aloud
Unto the the trees

Except for your sound
The sound that is
Of when you sing
And walk beneath
This canvas of leaves 
Free as your feet

But the soles of my shoes
And the lids of my eyes
Are now heavy 
As my head it lulls
And wants to roll
Back to the ground

So my pillow now 
Is underneath 
The hooded wood 
And as the world 
Slowly closes round
It’s you I see

Within the leaves
Beneath the trees

    





With Iron And Fire

Descriptive that is you</em>
Intensive that is me</em> 
Smithing you could be my steel 
And I the bellowing breath beneath
To coax the coal until it bursts
And explodes into this
The burning flame

    





Without Wind In The Sails

Somedays I am a ship which sails
No lull or shore could raise me to the ocean floor
When I am on a swell 
And yet somedays I’m lost on an oceanfront 
Floating 
Floating
Still

    





With starlight in eyes

You walked in
And I saw
For a moment struck by falling awe
The same starlight in your eyes
As had been within my dreams as of late
And like that
The morning of not knowing was over
And you were there in the afternoon

I didn't expect such starlight then

    





With Starlight In Her Eyes

When the skies turned cold, I never knew 
I only could hope to find and see...

But now the truth before me sits
Like an open sky,
Staring up at me.

And behind your eyes
Is the starlight I've longed to see

Till the dawn blade pierces the night
And the skies renew
Look up at me my most alive

See only me
With such starlight in your eyes

    





with truth like moonlight

fear holds no candle 
to the cooling night of truth 
which overwhelms the blinded eyes 
and - in its own reflective way - shines through

this moonlight is my own steadfast renewed

    





With Water Above

Poetry is a smooth stone slipping 
Wavering back and forth in the water beneath
And the fall of all in a slow transcendent arc 
Until it comes to rest
Finally 
Like all poetry 
At the end and beneath

    





With Your Eyes Closed

Feel the shade refresh your mind
The sunlight as it seeks your eyes

This is when you do your best writing
When you're most awake and alive

There is nothing wrong, nothing else
There's not an instant left for thought

Find
Not

There is only that which is less of you
There is only quiet in the stillness calm

Now reach out and pull towards you 
The burning truth which has always been

Shining like a Silmaril 
Endless, an eternal bright

Smile 
Though you can only feel the light

    





With your own

The strongest current
You could ever swim in
Is not against
But with your own

    





WOAHHHHH!!! (30K)

A verse, averse
I demand that it works 
(an announcement of sorts this could not be, dear self)
Although this dude did just reach
30,000 HePo words

Wow
That's felt

    





Wolf And Sheep

Sometimes I'm the sheep
Lost in a meadow with everything to graze
And sometimes I'm the wolf
Face deep in the fiery blood and steam

    





Wolverine

The steel inside my forearm
Has bent beneath the tremendous heat 
Of the forest fire burning in me 

How it roars and screams a passionate plea 
Not of agony but of fury 
Both in might and out of sight 

With hands outstretched 
Over top the sea of burning trees 
And temperatures boiling over uproariously 

You’ll hear the howl of this wolverine 
As it drowns out the earthly screams
Of a forest fire

Insurmountable and unquenchable by any stream

    





Words

If you cannot bend

Twist or appreciate them

Or use them in a more patient way

I want nothing

For you have nothing

And no power over me

For <strong>words</strong> are more than anything</em>

More than the abstract mind in all of it madness</em>

More beautiful than the mountains</em>

And more volatile than the sea</em>

Are such <strong>words</strong> 

If you let them

And I do

Be so

    





Words Are Cheap, Actions Cost Time

Speak and say whatever you want
Lending ears to hear as a skill indeed
Let the tongue-shaped mouth declare itself 
But watch also for these, for their actions to see
As the truth is often as shaped by the thought 
So also the action reveals the belief

    





Words Cannot Wait

Scribble a thousand, a million, down
Invent and scratch at the surface of create
Paw at the great cats still wandering around
And wait for them to speak in jazz
But leave, and leave a man alone with them
And but a moment later they'll be in his bed
Lying all around

The fat cat words cannot wait to be heard
They are always sounding and acting OUT

    





Words For A Wake Up

Yellow comes to mind 
When I hear your voice
How it sounds so alive 
Midst the dawning day

With eyes like morning sunlit rise
And a squinting glance which cannot stay
You are short and breathy as the mist
Which always tries but cannot reside

And when I wake up you're all of this
Within me and most definitely mine

    





Words For Her Comet

Herb
Root
Stem and tree
More beautiful is the turn of your hair
The bend of your neck 
Than a winding lane
You are more than these

    





Words Mean More At Night

Reflected rays
Reveal the truth 

Once read aloud 
Between the lines

That words remain
Longer than footprints

And with illuminate truth
The moonlight shines

    





Words, They Matter

Saying they don't matter
That they don't mean or mean other
Is far less fair than fire
Far colder than ice
And darker than the moonless night to be 
Cold and free as you wish
If you want to witness loneliness 
And the embodiment of whatcouldbe
Say they don't matter one more time

    





Wordy

Words carry me and coerce me
Drive me further away and on
They ever emplore me
Never employ me
Help to diversify me
And occasionally to yawn
Not just the at but with the person
I am impersonating myself
A staggering man
A sentenceless soul
A distant floodlight casting clouds
No word were ever a cry for help

    





Working Class

A desk is a chain
And a door a weight amongst a wait
And yet men and women chain themselves
To merely familiar similar fates
On a daily basis they do base
Their admirations on those without chains
But it couldn’t be
That IT were THEY
That freedom were found in a more free way

    





Worlds Around

Perspective is perspective based
As it takes no magnifying glass to find
That there are hidden worlds all around you to be found
Long lasting and prior existing
With Windows tall, and short, and high
If you'd only take the time to see them
And open your eyes
There's no telling what world next you'll be wandering through
Just to leave behind

    





Worry Out, Not In

Just about everything you worry about
Is not about 
And does not matter

It's the things you don't see
And do not worry about

Those are the things that you have to watch out for

    





Would You?

My shoulders a mountaintop 
My mind a sky
Would you climb?
Will you fly?

    





Would You With A Song?

You're very air 
Is a voice my ears drink deeply of 
Entranced by waters 
And by the tales of a home yet known 
If I sought out the trees 
To sing you back into my own song 
Would you hear me from this distance far
And come running
Knowing henceforth and forever 
Where you belong

    





Write Left

The only way to write is to write. 
To express yourself and express some more. 
And to speak your mind in every form, 
Until your tongue is stretched out across the floor.

And as you write, show no signs of remorse,
For the words which you’ve always adored.
 Since they only exist to be used by you, 
And abused by you as you write henceforth.

With a passion, gusto, pride, and fire, 
You must dig for the words which you desire, 
To represent your hollow shell. 
To speak of the heavens and of the hells,
 In which you may or may not have already dwelt.

Would you learn how to speak before you think, 
Be it only to share something distinctly known to you, 
Within your thoughts? 
Would you shape yourself into someone who’s not,
Afraid to question more often than not?

Because to write requires a questioning mind, 
Which struggles against the ebb of time, 
In the hourglass tipped on its side. 
Hence why we see our very lives, 
like shifting sands beneath our feet, 
And the grains our memories stored inside. 

So would you pull a perspective from within yourself, 
And pass it around, and hopes it will help. 
Because the truth to me most obviously, 
Is that the world will spin, 
But one day we will all die wordlessly.

And my hope for you is that you will write, 
For whatever is left in your own life, 
And not for whatever is next in line.

    





Write Without Boundaries

Break the line
As the back of a mountain 
To discover new ridges, peaks and valleys 
Twist the water, break the fountain 
And flow instead in unpredictable ways 
That is what Mr. Estlin would say

    





Writing As The Breeze Writes

An October night
With skin as our blankets, beneath
The windows screens, no longer white

A sudden chill, a rush of hope 
With silver skies out a windowsill
And the time to cope with life

We sleep, of sorts, with minds awake
And bodies lying still

    





Writing For Who?

I could tell you a tale
Of eyes like his or of hair like hers
And how such moved, or was, or is
But this is known
To all imaginations
That the retelling and told
Of an already known
Will not change your life
Though the telling of who
To whom through you
May yet remold
Your life into an amalgamate

    





Writing For You, Writing For Me

Tell me softly not to breathe
And it will be so
Long before I could stop creating this
The world in which I would like to be seen

And if you tell me something similar to this
"Write something for me"
Then all inspiration from me will flow
Away and from my pen it will flee

    





Writing Is Pouring Water Into A River

In this river I pour out
A glass of lasts
Of water within me
To return as a well
And rejuvenate self
I must rise again in this earth 
In order to be
I must go 
I must sleep

    





Writing To Be And Escape Me

Like an ocean out of easels 
I am drawn

Just as stars so many wander in
Like a child recently grown anew

And in walking so is hope revealed
To my remain both true and beating alive

Being all at the same place where my old words move
And I am left standing there alongside

    





Written For My Spinning World

The world spins ahead
Spins underneath
As my own head turns 
Along with the earth 
And tears itself apart in search
Of what quiet calm serenity can be
(And whatever personal tranquility)
Previously 
Had been

Yet madly I go on 
Beside my own self and being
In hope's of returning to me
Fully and free
My hope

    





Yearnings Of The Earth And Sky

Guttural rumble
As tree rings move 
So shifting Huorns call

Like bark rippling
In denim jeans
Refreshings 

And yet odd
The feeling is
Of springtime through the windows felt

At last
Let me step into it with being
Firm as rocks refined by subtle streams

For you are birchwood and in beige
A beauty of Earth
An eternal sky 

And moving less much
Like a tree
Will be the ever end of you and I

And so I move 
In premeditated you
To find us

The mere sight 
Of you
Makes such standard spirits fly

    





You, A Jazz Infused Drink

Pour my heart a Trenta drink
With lemon twist 
And jazzenough to fill 
My eyes with wonderment 
At your waist
A taste
This drink of you

    





You Call That Friendship?

Today I discovered 
What I already knew 
That our friendship will go
Only as far as our memories can carry it
Which is kind of sad really 
Because I cannot 
Will not
Should not
Anymore 
Adjust even just an inch for you

    





You can't hold the sky

It is right
And no wonder that I saw
And wrote you as starlight 

Because I cannot touch you

And I need a loving vision
Alive and learning
And closely burning 

Not at a distance
And for that, I'm not sorry

Sorry

    





You Come Over Me Like A Sudden Storm

With quiet whispers
Hands and eyes most closely held 
And wishes loud

Closed off to the world
Like two people as one
Are our most gentle clouds
(which may never meet)

With a friction near and voices mute
Beneath sky covered tones most bold
Which linger over dry heads
And warms the wondering air of what is

And in becoming yours, my mostly you
The hopeful thunder sings its sounds 
(of not knowing)
So our aftermath will not stop ringing 
In these ears of mine
And yours?

    





You Fall When You Fall

Falling is either a joke 
Or just that
A fall

No tripping or catching
When you fall
You fall

    





You Jelly?

Jellyfish 
How they float and fray and sting at random
A serious catch they are not in any specific way 
Sporty or otherwise, directional
You jelly?
You should be
At least the bending spine know it's own winding way
With a dorsal not carried by every tide
Or captivated by the time of day
You jelly?
You should be, hahaha!

    





Your Body, A Vacation

Your hair is sunlight fading slow
Kisses crashing on rocky outcrops
Skin a warming beach beneath
Where I dig and dig in sands of joy
And dream of sunsets underneath

In looking find and in knowing, know
You turn my fire to ember coals
My dreams to shallow shoals
In waiting seemingly never known
Your hair is sunlight ever fading slow

    





your chest a chest and heart beneath

I know where your heartbeat beats
Where ounces of breath meet silken skin
And tattered skyscrapers point freckles free
The mounds and valleys, where crevasses meet
There is also, where a fog to be found. there
An ocean to swell and boardwalk fingers walking underneath 
Like sands and stars and many pines to be
And thunder rolling ever on, warding the open plains outward 
It's with confidence I tap on the door of hope
Until a knock is seen
Having always been beneath your fair chest 
And I know where, because you're me

    





Your Heart, Inspires My Heart

Your heart
Inspires my heart
To beat

To breathe steam clouds onto cold windows
To feel the distant sunlight rise into Peachtree skies

The sound, the hum
Of you a lone
Tunes my ears to hear
My thoughts to song

With its quiet corridors and cushioned chest 
Rising like the waves of a coastal long 

Soughing whispers in the subtle trees
Midst the waiving of the Auburn leaves 

Our hopes a final parting leaf
On this, the last day of October joy

Know this

Your heart
Inspires my heart
To beat

From now until at last
Our distance is no more
We meet

    





your love song destroyed my universe

What started as an echo wave 
Reverberating across my moonlit lake 
In hues of white and shining starlight gray 
Has grown and flown, rippling like nether wings
As you've yet to be shown, yet shone another day

For you were eyes wide at the slightest path
Feet found friendly in the walking matter
And in the wake of Halley’s hue, unchanged
As if nothing out of reach were something real
Just as ripples of your sound, were, surreal and the same
 
As my own, but with a quake across my darkened veil 
Darts a newfound thought in me
Of water, you see didn't see, did you? 
That beneath the surface of this calm, I churn
Because of you and your distinct social sounds anew

I'm just saying
Your love song destroyed my universe
With it's crashing, falling, call, and crescendo growing tall
Into waters awake beneath the colors of sky 
You are all that which matters to me this Fall

To this ripple, a memory
Goodbye

    





Your Memory, A Crashing Wave

Even from a distance
Which I walked my own most knowingly
I can only stay inland so long
(My ocean)
Even from this distant sight I see
And am reminded of you still
Crashing over me
(In memories)

    





your memory is my favorite flame

I pulled out a tiny little cathexis stick 
and toasted the sky with your words of gray 
until they bubbled in brown 
and could breathe sweet again 
having been sent home 
to heaven where they belong 

Yours were never mine to keep

    





Your name (A Haiku)

Apart is the tear
Of myself and yours a piece 
Every time I hear

    





your neighbor will always be

Ghibli films feel right because
everything is just as it is
or was
or was secretly meant to be
Like grooves on a record
like trails of the cautious deer
or etchings upon ancient stones together 
You know, that what you're about to see
was designed to be seen
and seen uniquely 

Whatever your opinion is, you're right

    





your place away form my own

well or ill
or thought of or not
means less to me now
having been the constant
attentive focus
of your forgot

and yet fine
is me
in this unnatural sea
for your hold has no sway
and I have no such need
of you to set me free

    





Your seeing makes me bright

You are the restless morning
Breaking over dark horizons
Devoid of light

You see me through
And usher in the dawn
With glorious, knowing, radiant sight

You see me as I am
Not just how I live
And practice, play, at this impatient life 

No you are more than nothing 
Less than some
With all the coolness of this defeated night 

Your seeing makes me bright

    





Your Shirtsleeve World

Everything outside of your universe
Which you cannot SEE because you're already IN
Dictates what you are and have already been
Just a carbon based life form 
Just a volley of stars
Stretching out like milky moonlit sea
As you cannot shift what is out of reach
Or find with your eyes that which is out of sight
It is the thought ⁠— the study of that within glass ⁠— which allows you at last
To begin to begin

    





Your smile, about me?

I see your smile
so subtle and fine
And I am selfishly founded
on this belief of you, in us
And I 
I
I want it so badly to be only for me

    





Your Smile In August

With your smile being sunshine
Pure and unrelenting
Don't tell me that the night will come
Before our time

    





Your Song In Autumn

Like a cool breeze which weaves itself through the willow oaks, 
   So does this subtle sound cut deep through me. 

Wavering on a different kind of bow, 
 Reverberating the ink below into a different kind of note.

    So much so that when I hear the sound of the rustling leaves,   
   I dare not sleep, without a smile inquisitorial.

Not that sleep was an option amongst the trees, 
But I digress 
      And with conclusions leave. 

To forget the song of you for awhile, until you return once more,
    Rustling as you please.

    





Your Sound And My Cologne

Your sound it
Smells like my cologne in summer
Blue cotton polos in the sun
And red croquet mallets swinging
Like winning cheers and pretzel sticks 
By the train station studying
To be in school and not knowing

    





Your Subjective Is Opinion Here

Better is sometimes 
 s u b j e c t i v e (and) 
 borderline based on what has been or 
 has not been or 
 will not be or 
 wasn't ever meant

to
be

    





Your Vision Eludes Me (Always)

The only thing
To regret of this dream
Is in the waking up
The moving of
And the wanting to remember
What I never can

    





Youthful Summer, A Tanka

Flowers young breathing
In a new day morning shine
Basking in the glow
Of another Spring born young
Revealing a Summers teen

    





Youthful Trees

When you grow like a tree over property lines 
  And are drawn into a yard unwanting and free 
    It’s not the sharpest saw which cuts the deepest ties 
      But the quiet in moving away from beneath

    





You, Youth

Youth is forever to be desired

And fleeting and admired

And pitied and constructed

Into something more or less

No not so much

 

Youth is imperfectly young and lovely

Stupid and whole in its incompleteness lost

Just as downwardness is down

And skylight heat tries to rise


Youth is only you

So long as the youth 

Within you 

Is alive

    





Yukino Tanka

Lightning in the skies
Saturated <strong>clouds</strong> above
Moisture</em> in your eyes
And should the <strong>rain</strong> ere reprise
Would you always stay beside?
